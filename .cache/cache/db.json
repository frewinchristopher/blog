The world is still getting used to cryptocurrency. However, as soon as that honeymoon period is <em>over</em>, the world should (not as it always does, I know), realize a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin, while first to market, is unarguably <em>not</em> the best on the market. Even as I write this post, transaction times are stacking up, and a single transaction costs over $3.</li>\n<li>Litecoin is a copy of (suprised? look at this <a href=\"https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/commit/4405b78d6059e536c36974088a8ed4d9f0f29898\">fork to litecoin from the bitcoin repository by Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin</a>) sorry, but I don‚Äôt see much innovation there</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other blockchain technologies, like Ethereum, Cosmos, and many more (I have a few personal favorites) have numerous advantages, not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a much larger development team</li>\n<li>a much stronger and active code base</li>\n<li>MUCH faster transaction times (Ether, the next closes coin in market cap, processes about <em>2.5x</em> as many transactions as Bitcoin per day)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once these points are noticed, I believe wealth will slowly transfer out of Bitcoin - when and if enough people will decide that Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äòstore of wealth‚Äô could in fact be invested in the next best thing (i.e. coin/token). Perhaps once Bitcoin does reach such towering numbers of 50 - 100K, it‚Äôs purpose as a store of global wealth (note NOT the original purpose of Bitcoin) will be met, and perhaps the demand for transactions will taper off. On the other hand, perhaps even a better option for storing wealth in a blockchain could appear.

Then, at some point along this flattening, there will be an ever increase downtrend in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, bringing it to a very very low price. When will this happen?

We know that (for this example, I‚Äôm going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There‚Äôs a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that‚Äôs part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ‚Äù\\\\ServerName‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I‚Äôm going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let‚Äôs check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n‚Ä¶\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright‚Ä¶ Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP?

The world is still getting used to cryptocurrency. However, as soon as that honeymoon period is <em>over</em>, the world should (not as it always does, I know), realize a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin, while first to market, is unarguably <em>not</em> the best on the market. Even as I write this post, transaction times are stacking up, and a single transaction costs over $3.</li>\n<li>Litecoin is a copy of (suprised? look at this <a href=\"https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/commit/4405b78d6059e536c36974088a8ed4d9f0f29898\">fork to litecoin from the bitcoin repository by Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin</a>) sorry, but I don‚Äôt see much innovation there</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other blockchain technologies, like Ethereum, Cosmos, and many more (I have a few personal favorites) have numerous advantages, not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a much larger development team</li>\n<li>a much stronger and active code base</li>\n<li>MUCH faster transaction times (Ether, the next closes coin in market cap, processes about <em>2.5x</em> as many transactions as Bitcoin per day)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once these points are noticed, I believe wealth will slowly transfer out of Bitcoin - when and if enough people will decide that Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äòstore of wealth‚Äô could in fact be invested in the next best thing (i.e. coin/token). Perhaps once Bitcoin does reach such towering numbers of 50 - 100K, it‚Äôs purpose as a store of global wealth (note NOT the original purpose of Bitcoin) will be met, and perhaps the demand for transactions will taper off. On the other hand, perhaps even a better option for storing wealth in a blockchain could appear. With the rate of speed the tech is moving, its impossible to say, again, only time will tell.</p>\n<p>But, for the present, let the following stand:</p>\n<p><strong>as of 16:08 UTC, Tuesday December 12, 2017 the mid-market price on GDAX for 1 Bitcoin was $17,450.</strong></p>\n<h1>My Conclusions</h1>\n<p>My overall thoughts are this: Bitcoin will continue to see a run up into very large numbers in the 50K-100K region, then stabilize as buying rates finally settle down to match that of selling rates. Then, at some point along this flattening, there will be an ever increase downtrend in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, bringing it to a very very low price. When will this happen? I would say not within the next 5 years. But it‚Äôs my long term feeling.</p>\n<p>Cheers! üç∫</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-d4e8d538e04b156aafede58b1190b454-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: My First and Final Statement on Bitcoin for this Blog\ndate: \"2017-12-18\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":100},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Lots of words have been thrown around Bitcoin recently.

The world is still getting used to cryptocurrency. However, as soon as that honeymoon period is <em>over</em>, the world should (not as it always does, I know), realize a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin, while first to market, is unarguably <em>not</em> the best on the market. Even as I write this post, transaction times are stacking up, and a single transaction costs over $3.</li>\n<li>Litecoin is a copy of (suprised? look at this <a href=\"https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/commit/4405b78d6059e536c36974088a8ed4d9f0f29898\">fork to litecoin from the bitcoin repository by Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin</a>) sorry, but I don‚Äôt see much innovation there</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other blockchain technologies, like Ethereum, Cosmos, and many more (I have a few personal favorites) have numerous advantages, not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a much larger development team</li>\n<li>a much stronger and active code base</li>\n<li>MUCH faster transaction times (Ether, the next closes coin in market cap, processes about <em>2.5x</em> as many transactions as Bitcoin per day)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once these points are noticed, I believe wealth will slowly transfer out of Bitcoin - when and if enough people will decide that Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äòstore of wealth‚Äô could in fact be invested in the next best thing (i.e. coin/token). Perhaps once Bitcoin does reach such towering numbers of 50 - 100K, it‚Äôs purpose as a store of global wealth (note NOT the original purpose of Bitcoin) will be met, and perhaps the demand for transactions will taper off. On the other hand, perhaps even a better option for storing wealth in a blockchain could appear. With the rate of speed the tech is moving, its impossible to say, again, only time will tell.</p>\n<p>But, for the present, let the following stand:</p>\n<p><strong>as of 16:08 UTC, Tuesday December 12, 2017 the mid-market price on GDAX for 1 Bitcoin was $17,450.</strong></p>\n<h1>My Conclusions</h1>\n<p>My overall thoughts are this: Bitcoin will continue to see a run up into very large numbers in the 50K-100K region, then stabilize as buying rates finally settle down to match that of selling rates. Then, at some point along this flattening, there will be an ever increase downtrend in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, bringing it to a very very low price. When will this happen? I would say not within the next 5 years. But it‚Äôs my long term feeling.</p>\n<p>Cheers! üç∫</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-07bb45b3df9a3cb2729321bc4f417ccc-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: My First and Final Statement on Bitcoin for this Blog\ndate: \"2017-12-18\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":100},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Lots of words have been thrown around Bitcoin recently.

The world is still getting used to cryptocurrency. However, as soon as that honeymoon period is <em>over</em>, the world should (not as it always does, I know), realize a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin, while first to market, is unarguably <em>not</em> the best on the market. Even as I write this post, transaction times are stacking up, and a single transaction costs over $3.</li>\n<li>Litecoin is a copy of (suprised? look at this <a href=\"https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/commit/4405b78d6059e536c36974088a8ed4d9f0f29898\">fork to litecoin from the bitcoin repository by Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin</a>) sorry, but I don‚Äôt see much innovation there</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other blockchain technologies, like Ethereum, Cosmos, and many more (I have a few personal favorites) have numerous advantages, not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a much larger development team</li>\n<li>a much stronger and active code base</li>\n<li>MUCH faster transaction times (Ether, the next closes coin in market cap, processes about <em>2.5x</em> as many transactions as Bitcoin per day)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once these points are noticed, I believe wealth will slowly transfer out of Bitcoin - when and if enough people will decide that Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äòstore of wealth‚Äô could in fact be invested in the next best thing (i.e. coin/token). Perhaps once Bitcoin does reach such towering numbers of 50 - 100K, it‚Äôs purpose as a store of global wealth (note NOT the original purpose of Bitcoin) will be met, and perhaps the demand for transactions will taper off. On the other hand, perhaps even a better option for storing wealth in a blockchain could appear. With the rate of speed the tech is moving, its impossible to say, again, only time will tell.</p>\n<p>But, for the present, let the following stand:</p>\n<p><strong>as of 16:08 UTC, Tuesday December 12, 2017 the mid-market price on GDAX for 1 Bitcoin was $17,450.</strong></p>\n<h1>My Conclusions</h1>\n<p>My overall thoughts are this: Bitcoin will continue to see a run up into very large numbers in the 50K-100K region, then stabilize as buying rates finally settle down to match that of selling rates. Then, at some point along this flattening, there will be an ever increase downtrend in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, bringing it to a very very low price. When will this happen? I would say not within the next 5 years. But it‚Äôs my long term feeling.</p>\n<p>Cheers! üç∫</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-f80004d3d104cd3a944acf360f0063c0-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: My First and Final Statement on Bitcoin for this Blog\ndate: \"2017-12-18\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":100},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Lots of words have been thrown around Bitcoin recently.

The world is still getting used to cryptocurrency. However, as soon as that honeymoon period is <em>over</em>, the world should (not as it always does, I know), realize a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin, while first to the cryptocurrency market, is undoubtedly <em>not</em> the best cryptocurrency on the market. Even as I write this post, transaction times are stacking up, and a single transaction costs over $3.

Perhaps once Bitcoin does reach such towering numbers of 50 - 100K, it‚Äôs purpose as a store of global wealth (note NOT the original purpose of Bitcoin) will be met, and perhaps the demand for transactions will taper off.

The world is still getting used to cryptocurrency. However, as soon as that honeymoon period is <em>over</em>, the world should (not as it always does, I know), realize a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin, while first to the cryptocurrency market, is undoubtedly <em>not</em> the best cryptocurrency on the market. Even as I write this post, transaction times are stacking up, and a single transaction costs over $3. And what happens to the miners once mining stop? <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/what-happens-bitcoin-miners-all-coins-mined/\">That‚Äôs still a question where I‚Äôm not totally satisfied what some of the answers are.</a></li>\n<li>Litecoin is a copy of (suprised? look at this <a href=\"https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/commit/4405b78d6059e536c36974088a8ed4d9f0f29898\">fork to litecoin from the bitcoin repository by Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin</a>) sorry, but I don‚Äôt see much innovation there</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other blockchain technologies, like Ethereum, Cosmos, and many more (I have a few personal favorites) have numerous advantages, not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a much larger development team</li>\n<li>a much stronger and active code base</li>\n<li>MUCH faster transaction times (Ether, the next closes coin in market cap, processes about <em>2.5x</em> as many transactions as Bitcoin per day)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once these aspects of the market are noticed, I believe wealth will slowly transfer out of Bitcoin - when and if enough people will decide that Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äòstore of wealth‚Äô could in fact be invested in the next best thing (i.e. coin/token). Perhaps once Bitcoin does reach such towering numbers of 50 - 100K, it‚Äôs purpose as a store of global wealth (note NOT the original purpose of Bitcoin) will be met, and perhaps the demand for transactions will taper off. On the other hand, perhaps even a better option for storing wealth in a blockchain could appear. With the rate of speed the tech is moving, its impossible to say, again, only time will tell.</p>\n<p>But, for the present, let the following stand:</p>\n<p><strong>As of 16:08 UTC, Tuesday December 12, 2017 the mid-market price on GDAX for 1 Bitcoin was $17,450.</strong></p>\n<h1>My Conclusions</h1>\n<p>My overall thoughts are this: Bitcoin will continue to see a run up into very large numbers in the 50K-100K region, then stabilize as buying rates finally settle down to match that of selling rates. Then, at some point along this stagnation, there will be a slow starting decrease downtrend in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, then accelerating, bringing the price of Bitcoin back to its pre-boom levels (think: $5 - $10 range).

With the rate of speed the tech is moving, its impossible to say, again, only time will tell.</p>\n<p>But, for the present, let the following stand:</p>\n<p><strong>As of 16:08 UTC, Tuesday December 12, 2017 the mid-market price on GDAX for 1 Bitcoin was $17,450.</strong></p>\n<h1>My Conclusions</h1>\n<p>My overall thoughts are this: Bitcoin will continue to see a run up into very large numbers in the 50K-100K region, then stabilize as buying rates finally settle down to match that of selling rates. Then, at some point along this stagnation, there will be a slow starting decrease downtrend in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, then accelerating, bringing the price of Bitcoin back to its pre-boom levels (think: $5 - $10 range). When will this happen? I would say not within the next 5-10 years. But it‚Äôs my long term feeling.</p>\n<p>Cheers! üç∫</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-html-45e842b1f317e48a6f28ad999e1006b7-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":"<h1>How to Hotlink to lines of code in a Github repository</h1>\n<p>This‚Äôll be a real short one; I just realized you can link to specific lines of code on Github!</p>\n<h2>Single Line</h2>\n<p>All you need to do is find your link to the source code preview (NOTE: not the raw view!) as an example, let‚Äôs look at a source file from Bitcoin repository*:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c24337964f2d0500975abb4ef55c324daaf349b6/src/main.cpp\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c24337964f2d0500975abb4ef55c324daaf349b6/src/main.cpp</a></p>\n<p>Then, all you gotta do is add #L and the line you want, like if I want line 123, I add #L123 to the end</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c24337964f2d0500975abb4ef55c324daaf349b6/src/main.cpp#L123\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c24337964f2d0500975abb4ef55c324daaf349b6/src/main.cpp#L123</a></p>\n<p>Go on.

We know that (for this example, I‚Äôm going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There‚Äôs a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that‚Äôs part of the <code>sc</code> command.

Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I‚Äôm going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let‚Äôs check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get.

That much I already knew how to do - I had used custom command services in SAP/ABAP with transaction SM69 before. The hard thing that I got stuck with: how could I, from our SAP application server, issue a specific command, to the Service Control Manager, to a specific service? Whew. Still with me? With help from one of our basic team members, we discovered that as it turns out, Windows has a very nice command for exactly that.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs called <code>sc</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>C:\\>sc\nDESCRIPTION:\n        SC is a command line program used for communicating with the\n        Service Control Manager and services.\nUSAGE:\n        sc <server> [command] [service name] <option1> <option2>...\n\n\n        The option <server> has the form \"\\\\ServerName\"\n        Further help on commands can be obtained by typing: \"sc [command]\"\n        Commands:\n          query-----------Queries the status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          queryex---------Queries the extended status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          start-----------Starts a service.\n          pause-----------Sends a PAUSE control request to a service.\n          interrogate-----Sends an INTERROGATE control request to a service.\n          continue--------Sends a CONTINUE control request to a service.\n          stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.\n          config----------Changes the configuration of a service (persistent).\n          description-----Changes the description of a service.\n          failure---------Changes the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          failureflag-----Changes the failure actions flag of a service.\n          sidtype---------Changes the service SID type of a service.\n          privs-----------Changes the required privileges of a service.\n          managedaccount--Changes the service to mark the service account password as managed by LSA.\n          qc--------------Queries the configuration information for a service.\n          qdescription----Queries the description for a service.\n          qfailure--------Queries the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          qfailureflag----Queries the failure actions flag of a service.\n          qsidtype--------Queries the service SID type of a service.\n          qprivs----------Queries the required privileges of a service.\n          qtriggerinfo----Queries the trigger parameters of a service.\n          qpreferrednode--Queries the preferred NUMA node of a service.\n          qrunlevel-------Queries the run level of a service.\n          qmanagedaccount-Queries whether a services uses an account with a password managed by LSA.\n          qprotection-----Queries the process protection level of a service.\n          delete----------Deletes a service (from the registry).\n          create----------Creates a service.

[ y | n ]:</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Wow. That‚Äôs a monster of a command documentation. Let‚Äôs break down what we need.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The server name. We know that (for this example, I‚Äôm going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There‚Äôs a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that‚Äôs part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ‚Äù\\\\ServerName‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I‚Äôm going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let‚Äôs check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n‚Ä¶\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright‚Ä¶ Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP? Well, to run SM69 commands programmatically, we have the tasty function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXPORTING</span>\n    commandname                   <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_commandname\n    additional_parameters         <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_additional_parameters\n    operatingsystem               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_operatingsystem\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">TABLES</span>\n    exec_protocol                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gt_result\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    no_permission                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    command_not_found             <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span>\n    parameters_too_long           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span>\n    security_risk                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span>\n    wrong_check_call_interface    <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">5</span>\n    program_start_error           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">6</span>\n    program_termination_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span>\n    x_error                       <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span>\n    parameter_expected            <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">9</span>\n    too_many_parameters           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span>\n    illegal_command               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">11</span>\n    wrong_asynchronous_parameters <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span>\n    cant_enq_tbtco_entry          <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">13</span>\n    jobcount_generation_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">14</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">OTHERS</span>                        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>I‚Äôll just say I maintained the two commands in SM69 as <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_START</code> and <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_STOP</code>.</p>\n<p>So, all that‚Äôs left is to check if the service is not responding, and if it is not, call the command pair with function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>, check <code>sy-subrc</code>, and we are done!

That much I already knew how to do - I had used custom command services in SAP/ABAP with transaction SM69 before. The hard thing that I got stuck with: how could I, from our SAP application server, issue a specific command, to the Service Control Manager, to a specific service? Whew. Still with me?

We know that (for this example, I‚Äôm going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There‚Äôs a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that‚Äôs part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ‚Äù\\\\ServerName‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I‚Äôm going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let‚Äôs check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n‚Ä¶\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright‚Ä¶ Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP?

With help from one of our basic team members, we discovered that as it turns out, Windows has a very nice command for exactly that.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs called <code>sc</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>C:\\>sc\nDESCRIPTION:\n        SC is a command line program used for communicating with the\n        Service Control Manager and services.\nUSAGE:\n        sc <server> [command] [service name] <option1> <option2>...\n\n\n        The option <server> has the form \"\\\\ServerName\"\n        Further help on commands can be obtained by typing: \"sc [command]\"\n        Commands:\n          query-----------Queries the status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          queryex---------Queries the extended status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          start-----------Starts a service.\n          pause-----------Sends a PAUSE control request to a service.\n          interrogate-----Sends an INTERROGATE control request to a service.\n          continue--------Sends a CONTINUE control request to a service.\n          stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.\n          config----------Changes the configuration of a service (persistent).\n          description-----Changes the description of a service.\n          failure---------Changes the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          failureflag-----Changes the failure actions flag of a service.\n          sidtype---------Changes the service SID type of a service.\n          privs-----------Changes the required privileges of a service.\n          managedaccount--Changes the service to mark the service account password as managed by LSA.\n          qc--------------Queries the configuration information for a service.\n          qdescription----Queries the description for a service.\n          qfailure--------Queries the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          qfailureflag----Queries the failure actions flag of a service.\n          qsidtype--------Queries the service SID type of a service.\n          qprivs----------Queries the required privileges of a service.\n          qtriggerinfo----Queries the trigger parameters of a service.\n          qpreferrednode--Queries the preferred NUMA node of a service.\n          qrunlevel-------Queries the run level of a service.\n          qmanagedaccount-Queries whether a services uses an account with a password managed by LSA.\n          qprotection-----Queries the process protection level of a service.\n          delete----------Deletes a service (from the registry).\n          create----------Creates a service.

[ y | n ]:</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Wow. That‚Äôs a monster of a command documentation. Let‚Äôs break down what we need.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The server name. We know that (for this example, I‚Äôm going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There‚Äôs a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that‚Äôs part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ‚Äù\\\\ServerName‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I‚Äôm going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let‚Äôs check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n‚Ä¶\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright‚Ä¶ Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP? Well, to run SM69 commands programmatically, we have the tasty function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXPORTING</span>\n    commandname                   <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_commandname\n    additional_parameters         <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_additional_parameters\n    operatingsystem               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_operatingsystem\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">TABLES</span>\n    exec_protocol                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gt_result\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    no_permission                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    command_not_found             <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span>\n    parameters_too_long           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span>\n    security_risk                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span>\n    wrong_check_call_interface    <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">5</span>\n    program_start_error           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">6</span>\n    program_termination_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span>\n    x_error                       <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span>\n    parameter_expected            <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">9</span>\n    too_many_parameters           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span>\n    illegal_command               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">11</span>\n    wrong_asynchronous_parameters <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span>\n    cant_enq_tbtco_entry          <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">13</span>\n    jobcount_generation_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">14</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">OTHERS</span>                        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>I‚Äôll just say I maintained the two commands in SM69 as <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_START</code> and <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_STOP</code>.</p>\n<p>So, all that‚Äôs left is to check if the service is not responding.

We were able to verify if the service wasn‚Äôt working properly by pinging an RFC node. If the RFC ping returned with error, then we knew the service was not working - don‚Äôt worry, this RFC ping will come into the code later.</p>\n<p>One lazy Friday when I didn‚Äôt have much to do, I was brainstorming if it was possible that maybe I could take this ticket into my own hands, writing something on our ABAP stack that could do the trick.</p>\n<h1>The Problem</h1>\n<p>I knew at least that I had to issue specific commands to the command line. That much I already knew how to do - I had used custom command services in SAP/ABAP with transaction SM69 before. The hard thing that I got stuck with: how could I, from our SAP application server, issue a specific command, to the Service Control Manager, to a specific service? Whew. Still with me?

We know that (for this example, I‚Äôm going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There‚Äôs a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that‚Äôs part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ‚Äù\\\\ServerName‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I‚Äôm going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let‚Äôs check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n‚Ä¶\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright‚Ä¶ Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP?

We know that (for this example, I‚Äôm going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There‚Äôs a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that‚Äôs part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ‚Äù\\\\ServerName‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I‚Äôm going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let‚Äôs check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n‚Ä¶\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright‚Ä¶ Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP? Well, to run SM69 commands programmatically, we have the tasty function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXPORTING</span>\n    commandname                   <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_commandname\n    additional_parameters         <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_additional_parameters\n    operatingsystem               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_operatingsystem\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">TABLES</span>\n    exec_protocol                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gt_result\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    no_permission                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    command_not_found             <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span>\n    parameters_too_long           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span>\n    security_risk                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span>\n    wrong_check_call_interface    <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">5</span>\n    program_start_error           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">6</span>\n    program_termination_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span>\n    x_error                       <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span>\n    parameter_expected            <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">9</span>\n    too_many_parameters           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span>\n    illegal_command               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">11</span>\n    wrong_asynchronous_parameters <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span>\n    cant_enq_tbtco_entry          <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">13</span>\n    jobcount_generation_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">14</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">OTHERS</span>                        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>I‚Äôll just say I maintained the two commands in SM69 as <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_START</code> and <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_STOP</code>.</p>\n<p>So, all that‚Äôs left is to check if the service is not responding.

We were able to verify if the service wasn‚Äôt working properly by pinging an RFC node. If the RFC ping returned with error, then we knew the service was not working - don‚Äôt worry, this RFC ping will come into the code later.</p>\n<p>One lazy Friday when I didn‚Äôt have much to do, I was brainstorming if it was possible that maybe I could take this ticket into my own hands, writing something on our ABAP stack that could do the trick.</p>\n<h1>The Problem</h1>\n<p>I knew at least that I had to issue specific commands to the command line. That much I already knew how to do - I had used custom command services in SAP/ABAP with transaction SM69 before. The hard thing that I got stuck with: how could I, from our SAP application server, issue a specific command, to the Service Control Manager, to a specific service? Whew. Still with me?

We know that (for this example, I‚Äôm going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There‚Äôs a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that‚Äôs part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ‚Äù\\\\ServerName‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I‚Äôm going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let‚Äôs check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n‚Ä¶\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright‚Ä¶ Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP? Well, to run SM69 commands programmatically, we have the tasty function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXPORTING</span>\n    commandname                   <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_commandname\n    additional_parameters         <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_additional_parameters\n    operatingsystem               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_operatingsystem\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">TABLES</span>\n    exec_protocol                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gt_result\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    no_permission                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    command_not_found             <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span>\n    parameters_too_long           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span>\n    security_risk                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span>\n    wrong_check_call_interface    <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">5</span>\n    program_start_error           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">6</span>\n    program_termination_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span>\n    x_error                       <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span>\n    parameter_expected            <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">9</span>\n    too_many_parameters           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span>\n    illegal_command               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">11</span>\n    wrong_asynchronous_parameters <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span>\n    cant_enq_tbtco_entry          <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">13</span>\n    jobcount_generation_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">14</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">OTHERS</span>                        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>I‚Äôll just say I maintained the two commands in SM69 as <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_START</code> and <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_STOP</code>.</p>\n<p>So, all that‚Äôs left is to check if the service is not responding.

An RFC node is easy enough to test with function module <code>RFC_PING</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'RFC_PING'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">DESTINATION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    system_failure        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    communication_failure <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Easy enough. If <code>sy-subrc</code> is of value 1 or 2, then it means indeed, that our <code>Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION</code> is indeed broken.</p>\n<p>So if it turns out this service is not responding, we call the command pair with function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>, check <code>sy-subrc</code>, and we are done!

We know that (for this example, I‚Äôm going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There‚Äôs a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that‚Äôs part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ‚Äù\\\\ServerName‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I‚Äôm going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let‚Äôs check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n‚Ä¶\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright‚Ä¶ Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP? Well, to run SM69 commands programmatically, we have the tasty function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXPORTING</span>\n    commandname                   <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_commandname\n    additional_parameters         <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_additional_parameters\n    operatingsystem               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_operatingsystem\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">TABLES</span>\n    exec_protocol                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gt_result\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    no_permission                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    command_not_found             <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span>\n    parameters_too_long           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span>\n    security_risk                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span>\n    wrong_check_call_interface    <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">5</span>\n    program_start_error           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">6</span>\n    program_termination_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span>\n    x_error                       <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span>\n    parameter_expected            <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">9</span>\n    too_many_parameters           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span>\n    illegal_command               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">11</span>\n    wrong_asynchronous_parameters <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span>\n    cant_enq_tbtco_entry          <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">13</span>\n    jobcount_generation_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">14</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">OTHERS</span>                        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>I‚Äôll just say I maintained the two commands in SM69 as <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_START</code> and <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_STOP</code>.</p>\n<p>So, all that‚Äôs left is to check if the service is not responding. As I summarized above, if the Windows service was broken, the RFC node that talked to it would also be broken. (i.e. pinging it would not work). An RFC node is easy enough to test with function module <code>RFC_PING</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'RFC_PING'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">DESTINATION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    system_failure        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    communication_failure <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Easy enough.

We were able to verify if the service wasn‚Äôt working properly by pinging an RFC node. If the RFC ping returned with an error, then we knew the service was not working - don‚Äôt worry, this RFC ping will come into the code later.</p>\n<p>One lazy Friday when I didn‚Äôt have much to do, I was brainstorming if it was possible that maybe I could take this ticket into my own hands, writing something on our ABAP stack that could do the trick.</p>\n<h1>The Problem</h1>\n<p>I knew at least that I had to issue specific commands to the command line. That much I already knew how to do - I had used custom command services in SAP/ABAP with transaction SM69 before. The hard thing that I got stuck with: how could I, from our SAP application server, issue a specific command, to the Service Control Manager, to a specific service? Whew. Still with me?

We know that (for this example, I‚Äôm going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There‚Äôs a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that‚Äôs part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ‚Äù\\\\ServerName‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I‚Äôm going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let‚Äôs check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n‚Ä¶\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright‚Ä¶ Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP? Well, to run SM69 commands programmatically, we have the tasty function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXPORTING</span>\n    commandname                   <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_commandname\n    additional_parameters         <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_additional_parameters\n    operatingsystem               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_operatingsystem\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">TABLES</span>\n    exec_protocol                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gt_result\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    no_permission                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    command_not_found             <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span>\n    parameters_too_long           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span>\n    security_risk                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span>\n    wrong_check_call_interface    <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">5</span>\n    program_start_error           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">6</span>\n    program_termination_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span>\n    x_error                       <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span>\n    parameter_expected            <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">9</span>\n    too_many_parameters           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span>\n    illegal_command               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">11</span>\n    wrong_asynchronous_parameters <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span>\n    cant_enq_tbtco_entry          <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">13</span>\n    jobcount_generation_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">14</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">OTHERS</span>                        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>I‚Äôll just say I maintained the two commands in SM69 as <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_START</code> and <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_STOP</code>.</p>\n<p>So, all that‚Äôs left is to check if the service is not responding.

An RFC node is easy enough to test with function module <code>RFC_PING</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'RFC_PING'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">DESTINATION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    system_failure        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    communication_failure <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Easy enough. If <code>sy-subrc</code> is of value 1 or 2, then it means indeed, that our <code>Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION</code> is indeed broken.</p>\n<p>So if it turns out this service is not responding, we call the command pair with function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>, check <code>sy-subrc</code>, and we are done!

We know that (for this example, I‚Äôm going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There‚Äôs a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that‚Äôs part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ‚Äù\\\\ServerName‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I‚Äôm going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let‚Äôs check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n‚Ä¶\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright‚Ä¶ Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP? Well, to run SM69 commands programmatically, we have the tasty function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXPORTING</span>\n    commandname                   <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_commandname\n    additional_parameters         <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_additional_parameters\n    operatingsystem               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_operatingsystem\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">TABLES</span>\n    exec_protocol                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gt_result\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    no_permission                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    command_not_found             <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span>\n    parameters_too_long           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span>\n    security_risk                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span>\n    wrong_check_call_interface    <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">5</span>\n    program_start_error           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">6</span>\n    program_termination_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span>\n    x_error                       <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span>\n    parameter_expected            <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">9</span>\n    too_many_parameters           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span>\n    illegal_command               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">11</span>\n    wrong_asynchronous_parameters <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span>\n    cant_enq_tbtco_entry          <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">13</span>\n    jobcount_generation_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">14</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">OTHERS</span>                        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>I‚Äôll just say I maintained the two commands in SM69 as <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_START</code> and <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_STOP</code>.</p>\n<p>So, all that‚Äôs left is to check if the service is not responding. As I summarized above, if the Windows service was broken, the RFC node that talked to it would also be broken. (i.e. pinging it would not work). An RFC node is easy enough to test with function module <code>RFC_PING</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'RFC_PING'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">DESTINATION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    system_failure        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    communication_failure <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Easy enough. If <code>sy-subrc</code> is of value 1 or 2, then it means indeed, that our <code>Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION</code> is indeed broken.</p>\n<p>So if it turns out this service is not responding, we call the command pair with function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>, check <code>sy-subrc</code>, and we are done!

We were able to verify if the service wasn‚Äôt working properly by pinging an RFC node. If the RFC ping returned with an error, then we knew the service was not working - don‚Äôt worry, this RFC ping will come into the code later.</p>\n<p>One lazy Friday when I didn‚Äôt have much to do, I was brainstorming if it was possible that maybe I could take this ticket into my own hands, writing something on our ABAP stack that could do the trick.</p>\n<h1>The Problem</h1>\n<p>I knew at least that I had to issue specific commands to the command line. That much I already knew how to do - I had used custom command services in SAP/ABAP with transaction SM69 before. The hard thing that I got stuck with: how could I, from our SAP application server, issue a specific command, to the Service Control Manager, to a specific service? Whew. Still with me?

We know that (for this example, I‚Äôm going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There‚Äôs a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that‚Äôs part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ‚Äù\\\\ServerName‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I‚Äôm going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let‚Äôs check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n‚Ä¶\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright‚Ä¶ Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP? Well, to run SM69 commands programmatically, we have the tasty function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXPORTING</span>\n    commandname                   <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_commandname\n    additional_parameters         <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_additional_parameters\n    operatingsystem               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_operatingsystem\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">TABLES</span>\n    exec_protocol                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gt_result\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    no_permission                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    command_not_found             <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span>\n    parameters_too_long           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span>\n    security_risk                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span>\n    wrong_check_call_interface    <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">5</span>\n    program_start_error           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">6</span>\n    program_termination_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span>\n    x_error                       <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span>\n    parameter_expected            <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">9</span>\n    too_many_parameters           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span>\n    illegal_command               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">11</span>\n    wrong_asynchronous_parameters <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span>\n    cant_enq_tbtco_entry          <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">13</span>\n    jobcount_generation_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">14</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">OTHERS</span>                        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>I‚Äôll just say I maintained the two commands in SM69 as <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_START</code> and <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_STOP</code>.</p>\n<p>So, all that‚Äôs left is to check if the service is not responding.

An RFC node is easy enough to test with function module <code>RFC_PING</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'RFC_PING'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">DESTINATION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    system_failure        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    communication_failure <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Easy enough. If <code>sy-subrc</code> is of value 1 or 2, then it means indeed, that our <code>Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION</code> is indeed broken.</p>\n<p>So if it turns out this service is not responding, we call the command pair with function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>, check <code>sy-subrc</code>, and we are done! The total code looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">REPORT</span> Z_RESTART_SERVICE<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp;---------------------------------------------------------------------*</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp; Report:  Z_RESTART_SERVICE                                          *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp; Author: Chris Frewin                                                *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp; Creation Date: 27.10.2017                                           *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp;---------------------------------------------------------------------*</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp; Requester:                                                          *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp; Chris Frewin - a report that restarts a windows service             *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp;                                                                     *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp;                                                                     *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp;---------------------------------------------------------------------*</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp; Changes:                                                            *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp; Chris Frewin      2017.12.13 - First version                        *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp;                                                                     *</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">*&amp;---------------------------------------------------------------------*</span>\n\n<span class=\"token eol-comment comment\">\" Check RFC destination Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION - if it hangs or returns error, try to restart it</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'RFC_PING'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">DESTINATION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    system_failure        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    communication_failure <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">IF</span> sy<span class=\"token token-operator punctuation\">-</span>subrc <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;></span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">CASE</span> sy<span class=\"token token-operator punctuation\">-</span>subrc<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">WHEN</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n      <span class=\"token keyword\">WRITE</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token operator\">/</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Ping Test RFC Destination Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION with SY-SUBRC = 1: \"system_failure\" Trying to restart the service...'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">WHEN</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n      <span class=\"token keyword\">WRITE</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token operator\">/</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Ping Test RFC Destination Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION with SY-SUBRC = 2: \"communication_failure\" Trying to restart the service...'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">WHEN</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">OTHERS</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n      <span class=\"token keyword\">WRITE</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token operator\">/</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Ping Test RFC Destination Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION is offline or not functioning properly!

I‚Äôm going to be posting a lot more ABAP as well as SAPUI5 content in the coming months. I‚Äôve found that the learning curve for SAPUI5 is a lot higher than other frontend frameworks like React, Vue, or Cycle. I‚Äôve done specialized projects with SAPUI5 is both the EWM and PP modules - There is A LOT of really cool stuff you can do, (especially in EWM) with WebSockets, statistics, and SAPUI5.
