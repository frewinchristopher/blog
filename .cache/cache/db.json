Lots of people on podcasts say it I say screw that. That is a lot like saying, “oh hey, did you know it’s impossible to write great apps or games if you’re a solo developer?” or, “What?!?! A nice dynamic UI, <em>with</em> a relational database backend <em>and</em> a websocket to send messages between the two!?!? You’re a madman!!!“.</p>\n<p>Wait a second - isn’t that what this whole Web 3.0 stuff is supposed to do? Empower developers to make great apps all by themselves? I mean jeez, I know us, we’ve spent hours on hours learning python, backend databases, container deploys, dabbled in numerous backend frameworks, not even getting started with your favorite modern front end framework of choice (yeah, there’s a lot of those too!) like Vue, React, Ember or more.</p>\n<p>Of course full stack developers know they are more a less a jack of all trades, master of none. I know there are people who could kick my ass at both Postgresql database maintenence, and there are just as many frontend people who could totally kick my ass with a badass UI in React.</p>\n<p>For me, full stack has always been about the adventure of software itself - its the nature of the discepline in fact - there are new tools being rolled out literally every day. I mean, really, if you’ve written backend code for databases but have also built websites (I know there are many of us out there!)- how are you supposed to write that susincctly on a resume or CV? “Hi, I’m Chris, part-time-database-program-writer-and-part-time-front-end-engineer”? I do concede that the moniker ‘full stack’ is not really a good enough description by itself. In my case, I could say ‘full stack <em>web developer</em>’.

We know that (for this example, I’m going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There’s a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That’s not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that’s part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ”\\\\ServerName”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I’m going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let’s check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n…\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright… Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP?

We know that (for this example, I’m going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There’s a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That’s not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that’s part of the <code>sc</code> command.

Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I’m going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let’s check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get.

We know that (for this example, I’m going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There’s a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That’s not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that’s part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ”\\\\ServerName”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I’m going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let’s check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n…\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright… Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP?

We know that (for this example, I’m going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There’s a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That’s not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that’s part of the <code>sc</code> command.

Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I’m going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let’s check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n…\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright… Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP?

I’ve found that the learning curve for SAPUI5 is a lot higher than other front-end frameworks like . What I’ve specialized in with SAPUI5 is both the EWM and PP modules - There is A LOT of really cool stuff you can do, especially in EWM with websockets, statistics, and SAPUI5. The bottom line is, I’ve got some great content in the coming months for everyone!</p>\n<p>Cheers everyone! 🍺</p>\n<p><em>Intellectual property disclaimer: the exact source code and use case have been modified from the real use case at the company I work for, <a href=\"https://www.ospelt.com/en/ospelt/info/home.html\">Ospelt</a>.</em></p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-893249f24af7a8633d1d7aafb8a445c9-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: Sending Windows Server Commands From SAP ABAP\ndate: \"2017-12-13\"","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":4,"column":4,"offset":79},"indent":[1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Alright, let’s do a bit of applied stuff today.","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":81},"end":{"line":6,"column":48,"offset":128},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":81},"end":{"line":6,"column":48,"offset":128},"indent":[]}},{"type":"heading","depth":1,"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Backstory","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":3,"offset":132},"end":{"line":8,"column":12,"offset":141},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":130},"end":{"line":8,"column":12,"offset":141},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"For a long time, I had a ticket open for our IT team (I am likewise in the SAP team) for a automatic job that would restart a certain task on a windows server we had - for reasons we still don’t know yet, this particular service would state that it was running, when in fact the job it was supposed to be orchestrating was clearly not running.","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":1,"offset":143},"end":{"line":10,"column":344,"offset":486},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":1,"offset":143},"end":{"line":10,"column":344,"offset":486},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"One lazy Friday when I didn’t have much to do, I was brainstorming if it was possible that maybe I could take this ticket into my own hands, writing something on our ABAP stack that could do the trick.","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1,"offset":488},"end":{"line":12,"column":202,"offset":689},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1,"offset":488},"end":{"line":12,"column":202,"offset":689},"indent":[]}},{"type":"heading","depth":1,"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Problem","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":3,"offset":693},"end":{"line":14,"column":14,"offset":704},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1,"offset":691},"end":{"line":14,"column":14,"offset":704},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I knew at least that I had to issue specific commands to the command line.

We know that (for this example, I’m going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There’s a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That’s not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that’s part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ”\\\\ServerName”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I’m going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let’s check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n…\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright… Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP?

With help from one of our basic team members, we discovered that as it turns out, Windows has a very nice command for exactly that.","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":1,"offset":706},"end":{"line":16,"column":507,"offset":1212},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":1,"offset":706},"end":{"line":16,"column":507,"offset":1212},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"It’s called ","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1,"offset":1214},"end":{"line":18,"column":13,"offset":1226},"indent":[]}},{"type":"inlineCode","value":"sc","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":13,"offset":1226},"end":{"line":18,"column":17,"offset":1230},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":":","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":17,"offset":1230},"end":{"line":18,"column":18,"offset":1231},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1,"offset":1214},"end":{"line":18,"column":18,"offset":1231},"indent":[]}},{"type":"html","lang":null,"value":"<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>C:\\>sc\nDESCRIPTION:\n        SC is a command line program used for communicating with the\n        Service Control Manager and services.\nUSAGE:\n        sc <server> [command] [service name] <option1> <option2>...\n\n\n        The option <server> has the form \"\\\\ServerName\"\n        Further help on commands can be obtained by typing: \"sc [command]\"\n        Commands:\n          query-----------Queries the status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          queryex---------Queries the extended status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          start-----------Starts a service.\n          pause-----------Sends a PAUSE control request to a service.\n          interrogate-----Sends an INTERROGATE control request to a service.\n          continue--------Sends a CONTINUE control request to a service.\n          stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.\n          config----------Changes the configuration of a service (persistent).\n          description-----Changes the description of a service.\n          failure---------Changes the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          failureflag-----Changes the failure actions flag of a service.\n          sidtype---------Changes the service SID type of a service.\n          privs-----------Changes the required privileges of a service.\n          managedaccount--Changes the service to mark the service account password as managed by LSA.\n          qc--------------Queries the configuration information for a service.\n          qdescription----Queries the description for a service.\n          qfailure--------Queries the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          qfailureflag----Queries the failure actions flag of a service.\n          qsidtype--------Queries the service SID type of a service.\n          qprivs----------Queries the required privileges of a service.\n          qtriggerinfo----Queries the trigger parameters of a service.\n          qpreferrednode--Queries the preferred NUMA node of a service.\n          qrunlevel-------Queries the run level of a service.\n          qmanagedaccount-Queries whether a services uses an account with a password managed by LSA.\n          qprotection-----Queries the process protection level of a service.\n          delete----------Deletes a service (from the registry).\n          create----------Creates a service.

There’s a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That’s not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that’s part of the <code>sc</code> command.

Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I’m going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let’s check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get.

It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP?

I’m going to be posting a lot more ABAP as well as SAPUI5 content in the coming months. I’ve found that the learning curve for SAPUI5 is a lot higher than other frontend frameworks like React, Vue, or Cycle. I’ve done specialized projects with SAPUI5 is both the EWM and PP modules - There is A LOT of really cool stuff you can do, especially in EWM with websockets, statistics, and SAPUI5. The bottom line is, I’ve got some great content in the coming months for everyone!</p>\n<p>Cheers everyone! 🍺</p>\n<p><em>Intellectual property disclaimer: the exact source code and use case have been modified from the real use case at the company I work for, <a href=\"https://www.ospelt.com/en/ospelt/info/home.html\">Ospelt</a>.</em></p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-8072a653df8c13967bc2caca51b194a2-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: Sending Windows Server Commands From SAP ABAP\ndate: \"2017-12-13\"","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":4,"column":4,"offset":79},"indent":[1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Alright, let’s do a bit of applied stuff today.","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":81},"end":{"line":6,"column":48,"offset":128},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":81},"end":{"line":6,"column":48,"offset":128},"indent":[]}},{"type":"heading","depth":1,"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Backstory","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":3,"offset":132},"end":{"line":8,"column":12,"offset":141},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":130},"end":{"line":8,"column":12,"offset":141},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"For a long time, I had a ticket open for our IT team (I am likewise in the SAP team) for a automatic job that would restart a certain task on a windows server we had - for reasons we still don’t know yet, this particular service would state that it was running, when in fact the job it was supposed to be orchestrating was clearly not running.","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":1,"offset":143},"end":{"line":10,"column":344,"offset":486},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":1,"offset":143},"end":{"line":10,"column":344,"offset":486},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"One lazy Friday when I didn’t have much to do, I was brainstorming if it was possible that maybe I could take this ticket into my own hands, writing something on our ABAP stack that could do the trick.","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1,"offset":488},"end":{"line":12,"column":202,"offset":689},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1,"offset":488},"end":{"line":12,"column":202,"offset":689},"indent":[]}},{"type":"heading","depth":1,"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Problem","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":3,"offset":693},"end":{"line":14,"column":14,"offset":704},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1,"offset":691},"end":{"line":14,"column":14,"offset":704},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"I knew at least that I had to issue specific commands to the command line.

We know that (for this example, I’m going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There’s a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That’s not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that’s part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ”\\\\ServerName”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I’m going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let’s check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n…\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright… Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP?

With help from one of our basic team members, we discovered that as it turns out, Windows has a very nice command for exactly that.","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":1,"offset":706},"end":{"line":16,"column":507,"offset":1212},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":1,"offset":706},"end":{"line":16,"column":507,"offset":1212},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"It’s called ","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1,"offset":1214},"end":{"line":18,"column":13,"offset":1226},"indent":[]}},{"type":"inlineCode","value":"sc","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":13,"offset":1226},"end":{"line":18,"column":17,"offset":1230},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":":","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":17,"offset":1230},"end":{"line":18,"column":18,"offset":1231},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1,"offset":1214},"end":{"line":18,"column":18,"offset":1231},"indent":[]}},{"type":"html","lang":null,"value":"<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>C:\\>sc\nDESCRIPTION:\n        SC is a command line program used for communicating with the\n        Service Control Manager and services.\nUSAGE:\n        sc <server> [command] [service name] <option1> <option2>...\n\n\n        The option <server> has the form \"\\\\ServerName\"\n        Further help on commands can be obtained by typing: \"sc [command]\"\n        Commands:\n          query-----------Queries the status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          queryex---------Queries the extended status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          start-----------Starts a service.\n          pause-----------Sends a PAUSE control request to a service.\n          interrogate-----Sends an INTERROGATE control request to a service.\n          continue--------Sends a CONTINUE control request to a service.\n          stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.\n          config----------Changes the configuration of a service (persistent).\n          description-----Changes the description of a service.\n          failure---------Changes the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          failureflag-----Changes the failure actions flag of a service.\n          sidtype---------Changes the service SID type of a service.\n          privs-----------Changes the required privileges of a service.\n          managedaccount--Changes the service to mark the service account password as managed by LSA.\n          qc--------------Queries the configuration information for a service.\n          qdescription----Queries the description for a service.\n          qfailure--------Queries the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          qfailureflag----Queries the failure actions flag of a service.\n          qsidtype--------Queries the service SID type of a service.\n          qprivs----------Queries the required privileges of a service.\n          qtriggerinfo----Queries the trigger parameters of a service.\n          qpreferrednode--Queries the preferred NUMA node of a service.\n          qrunlevel-------Queries the run level of a service.\n          qmanagedaccount-Queries whether a services uses an account with a password managed by LSA.\n          qprotection-----Queries the process protection level of a service.\n          delete----------Deletes a service (from the registry).\n          create----------Creates a service.

That much I already knew how to do - I had used custom command services in SAP/ABAP with transaction SM69 before. The hard thing that I got stuck with: how could I, from our SAP application server, issue a specific command, to the Service Control Manager, to a specific service? Whew. Still with me? With help from one of our basic team members, we discovered that as it turns out, Windows has a very nice command for exactly that.</p>\n<p>It’s called <code>sc</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-none\"><code>C:\\>sc\nDESCRIPTION:\n        SC is a command line program used for communicating with the\n        Service Control Manager and services.\nUSAGE:\n        sc <server> [command] [service name] <option1> <option2>...\n\n\n        The option <server> has the form \"\\\\ServerName\"\n        Further help on commands can be obtained by typing: \"sc [command]\"\n        Commands:\n          query-----------Queries the status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          queryex---------Queries the extended status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          start-----------Starts a service.\n          pause-----------Sends a PAUSE control request to a service.\n          interrogate-----Sends an INTERROGATE control request to a service.\n          continue--------Sends a CONTINUE control request to a service.\n          stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.\n          config----------Changes the configuration of a service (persistent).\n          description-----Changes the description of a service.\n          failure---------Changes the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          failureflag-----Changes the failure actions flag of a service.\n          sidtype---------Changes the service SID type of a service.\n          privs-----------Changes the required privileges of a service.\n          managedaccount--Changes the service to mark the service account password as managed by LSA.\n          qc--------------Queries the configuration information for a service.\n          qdescription----Queries the description for a service.\n          qfailure--------Queries the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          qfailureflag----Queries the failure actions flag of a service.\n          qsidtype--------Queries the service SID type of a service.\n          qprivs----------Queries the required privileges of a service.\n          qtriggerinfo----Queries the trigger parameters of a service.\n          qpreferrednode--Queries the preferred NUMA node of a service.\n          qrunlevel-------Queries the run level of a service.\n          qmanagedaccount-Queries whether a services uses an account with a password managed by LSA.\n          qprotection-----Queries the process protection level of a service.\n          delete----------Deletes a service (from the registry).\n          create----------Creates a service.

We know that (for this example, I’m going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There’s a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That’s not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that’s part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ”\\\\ServerName”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I’m going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let’s check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n…\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright… Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP? Well, to run SM69 commands programmatically, we have the tasty function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-abap\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">CALL</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">FUNCTION</span> <span class=\"token string\">'SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE'</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXPORTING</span>\n    commandname                   <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_commandname\n    additional_parameters         <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_additional_parameters\n    operatingsystem               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gv_operatingsystem\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">TABLES</span>\n    exec_protocol                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> gt_result\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    no_permission                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span>\n    command_not_found             <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span>\n    parameters_too_long           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span>\n    security_risk                 <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span>\n    wrong_check_call_interface    <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">5</span>\n    program_start_error           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">6</span>\n    program_termination_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">7</span>\n    x_error                       <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span>\n    parameter_expected            <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">9</span>\n    too_many_parameters           <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span>\n    illegal_command               <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">11</span>\n    wrong_asynchronous_parameters <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span>\n    cant_enq_tbtco_entry          <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">13</span>\n    jobcount_generation_error     <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">14</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">OTHERS</span>                        <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">15</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>I’ll just say I maintained the two commands in SM69 as <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_START</code> and <code>Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_STOP</code>.</p>\n<p>So, all that’s left is to check if the service is not responding, and if it is not, call the command pair with function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>, check <code>sy-subrc</code>, and we are done!
