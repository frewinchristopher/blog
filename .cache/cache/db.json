The world is still getting used to cryptocurrency. However, as soon as that honeymoon period is <em>over</em>, the world should (not as it always does, I know), realize a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin, while first to market, is unarguably <em>not</em> the best on the market. Even as I write this post, transaction times are stacking up, and a single transaction costs over $3.</li>\n<li>Litecoin is a copy of (suprised? look at this <a href=\"https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/commit/4405b78d6059e536c36974088a8ed4d9f0f29898\">fork to litecoin from the bitcoin repository by Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin</a>) sorry, but I don‚Äôt see much innovation there</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other blockchain technologies, like Ethereum, Cosmos, and many more (I have a few personal favorites) have numerous advantages, not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a much larger development team</li>\n<li>a much stronger and active code base</li>\n<li>MUCH faster transaction times (Ether, the next closes coin in market cap, processes about <em>2.5x</em> as many transactions as Bitcoin per day)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once these points are noticed, I believe wealth will slowly transfer out of Bitcoin - when and if enough people will decide that Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äòstore of wealth‚Äô could in fact be invested in the next best thing (i.e. coin/token). Perhaps once Bitcoin does reach such towering numbers of 50 - 100K, it‚Äôs purpose as a store of global wealth (note NOT the original purpose of Bitcoin) will be met, and perhaps the demand for transactions will taper off. On the other hand, perhaps even a better option for storing wealth in a blockchain could appear.

Then, at some point along this flattening, there will be an ever increase downtrend in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, bringing it to a very very low price. When will this happen?

We know that (for this example, I‚Äôm going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There‚Äôs a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that‚Äôs part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ‚Äù\\\\ServerName‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I‚Äôm going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Okay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let‚Äôs check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n‚Ä¶\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Alright‚Ä¶ Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>In order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP?

The world is still getting used to cryptocurrency. However, as soon as that honeymoon period is <em>over</em>, the world should (not as it always does, I know), realize a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin, while first to market, is unarguably <em>not</em> the best on the market. Even as I write this post, transaction times are stacking up, and a single transaction costs over $3.</li>\n<li>Litecoin is a copy of (suprised? look at this <a href=\"https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/commit/4405b78d6059e536c36974088a8ed4d9f0f29898\">fork to litecoin from the bitcoin repository by Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin</a>) sorry, but I don‚Äôt see much innovation there</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other blockchain technologies, like Ethereum, Cosmos, and many more (I have a few personal favorites) have numerous advantages, not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a much larger development team</li>\n<li>a much stronger and active code base</li>\n<li>MUCH faster transaction times (Ether, the next closes coin in market cap, processes about <em>2.5x</em> as many transactions as Bitcoin per day)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once these points are noticed, I believe wealth will slowly transfer out of Bitcoin - when and if enough people will decide that Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äòstore of wealth‚Äô could in fact be invested in the next best thing (i.e. coin/token). Perhaps once Bitcoin does reach such towering numbers of 50 - 100K, it‚Äôs purpose as a store of global wealth (note NOT the original purpose of Bitcoin) will be met, and perhaps the demand for transactions will taper off. On the other hand, perhaps even a better option for storing wealth in a blockchain could appear. With the rate of speed the tech is moving, its impossible to say, again, only time will tell.</p>\n<p>But, for the present, let the following stand:</p>\n<p><strong>as of 16:08 UTC, Tuesday December 12, 2017 the mid-market price on GDAX for 1 Bitcoin was $17,450.</strong></p>\n<h1>My Conclusions</h1>\n<p>My overall thoughts are this: Bitcoin will continue to see a run up into very large numbers in the 50K-100K region, then stabilize as buying rates finally settle down to match that of selling rates. Then, at some point along this flattening, there will be an ever increase downtrend in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, bringing it to a very very low price. When will this happen? I would say not within the next 5 years. But it‚Äôs my long term feeling.</p>\n<p>Cheers! üç∫</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-d4e8d538e04b156aafede58b1190b454-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: My First and Final Statement on Bitcoin for this Blog\ndate: \"2017-12-18\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":100},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Lots of words have been thrown around Bitcoin recently.

The world is still getting used to cryptocurrency. However, as soon as that honeymoon period is <em>over</em>, the world should (not as it always does, I know), realize a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin, while first to market, is unarguably <em>not</em> the best on the market. Even as I write this post, transaction times are stacking up, and a single transaction costs over $3.</li>\n<li>Litecoin is a copy of (suprised? look at this <a href=\"https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/commit/4405b78d6059e536c36974088a8ed4d9f0f29898\">fork to litecoin from the bitcoin repository by Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin</a>) sorry, but I don‚Äôt see much innovation there</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other blockchain technologies, like Ethereum, Cosmos, and many more (I have a few personal favorites) have numerous advantages, not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a much larger development team</li>\n<li>a much stronger and active code base</li>\n<li>MUCH faster transaction times (Ether, the next closes coin in market cap, processes about <em>2.5x</em> as many transactions as Bitcoin per day)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once these points are noticed, I believe wealth will slowly transfer out of Bitcoin - when and if enough people will decide that Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äòstore of wealth‚Äô could in fact be invested in the next best thing (i.e. coin/token). Perhaps once Bitcoin does reach such towering numbers of 50 - 100K, it‚Äôs purpose as a store of global wealth (note NOT the original purpose of Bitcoin) will be met, and perhaps the demand for transactions will taper off. On the other hand, perhaps even a better option for storing wealth in a blockchain could appear. With the rate of speed the tech is moving, its impossible to say, again, only time will tell.</p>\n<p>But, for the present, let the following stand:</p>\n<p><strong>as of 16:08 UTC, Tuesday December 12, 2017 the mid-market price on GDAX for 1 Bitcoin was $17,450.</strong></p>\n<h1>My Conclusions</h1>\n<p>My overall thoughts are this: Bitcoin will continue to see a run up into very large numbers in the 50K-100K region, then stabilize as buying rates finally settle down to match that of selling rates. Then, at some point along this flattening, there will be an ever increase downtrend in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, bringing it to a very very low price. When will this happen? I would say not within the next 5 years. But it‚Äôs my long term feeling.</p>\n<p>Cheers! üç∫</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-07bb45b3df9a3cb2729321bc4f417ccc-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: My First and Final Statement on Bitcoin for this Blog\ndate: \"2017-12-18\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":100},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Lots of words have been thrown around Bitcoin recently.

The world is still getting used to cryptocurrency. However, as soon as that honeymoon period is <em>over</em>, the world should (not as it always does, I know), realize a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin, while first to market, is unarguably <em>not</em> the best on the market. Even as I write this post, transaction times are stacking up, and a single transaction costs over $3.</li>\n<li>Litecoin is a copy of (suprised? look at this <a href=\"https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/commit/4405b78d6059e536c36974088a8ed4d9f0f29898\">fork to litecoin from the bitcoin repository by Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin</a>) sorry, but I don‚Äôt see much innovation there</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other blockchain technologies, like Ethereum, Cosmos, and many more (I have a few personal favorites) have numerous advantages, not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a much larger development team</li>\n<li>a much stronger and active code base</li>\n<li>MUCH faster transaction times (Ether, the next closes coin in market cap, processes about <em>2.5x</em> as many transactions as Bitcoin per day)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once these points are noticed, I believe wealth will slowly transfer out of Bitcoin - when and if enough people will decide that Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äòstore of wealth‚Äô could in fact be invested in the next best thing (i.e. coin/token). Perhaps once Bitcoin does reach such towering numbers of 50 - 100K, it‚Äôs purpose as a store of global wealth (note NOT the original purpose of Bitcoin) will be met, and perhaps the demand for transactions will taper off. On the other hand, perhaps even a better option for storing wealth in a blockchain could appear. With the rate of speed the tech is moving, its impossible to say, again, only time will tell.</p>\n<p>But, for the present, let the following stand:</p>\n<p><strong>as of 16:08 UTC, Tuesday December 12, 2017 the mid-market price on GDAX for 1 Bitcoin was $17,450.</strong></p>\n<h1>My Conclusions</h1>\n<p>My overall thoughts are this: Bitcoin will continue to see a run up into very large numbers in the 50K-100K region, then stabilize as buying rates finally settle down to match that of selling rates. Then, at some point along this flattening, there will be an ever increase downtrend in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, bringing it to a very very low price. When will this happen? I would say not within the next 5 years. But it‚Äôs my long term feeling.</p>\n<p>Cheers! üç∫</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-f80004d3d104cd3a944acf360f0063c0-gatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypantsgatsby-remark-emoji","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"yaml","value":"title: My First and Final Statement on Bitcoin for this Blog\ndate: \"2017-12-18\"\ndraft: false","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":5,"column":4,"offset":100},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Lots of words have been thrown around Bitcoin recently.

The world is still getting used to cryptocurrency. However, as soon as that honeymoon period is <em>over</em>, the world should (not as it always does, I know), realize a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin, while first to the cryptocurrency market, is undoubtedly <em>not</em> the best cryptocurrency on the market. Even as I write this post, transaction times are stacking up, and a single transaction costs over $3.

Perhaps once Bitcoin does reach such towering numbers of 50 - 100K, it‚Äôs purpose as a store of global wealth (note NOT the original purpose of Bitcoin) will be met, and perhaps the demand for transactions will taper off.

Tulip Madness. Silk Road. Ponzi Scheme. While this blog will (rest assured) remain about software development and programming, I had to give my final say (barring whatever crap I may spew on reddit from time to time üòÑ) SOMEWHERE about Bitcoin. I decided that somewhere was here.</p>\n<h1>My Promise to You</h1>\n<p>Let me promise you, I won‚Äôt post about Bitcoin speculation (in relation to politics or economics, maybe one day some tech stuff) on this blog ever again.</p>\n<h1>The Numbers</h1>\n<p>The simple economics of Bitcoin are: there will only every 21 million of them, Bitcoin was the first of its kind (certainly not the best - many improvements in other coins and blockchain protocols exist - more on that below). But the fact still stands, Bitcoin has both the largest <em>and</em> majority of the market caps among all the other cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A comic I thought up about Bitcoin  üòÇüòÇüòÇ (<em>still not done, but it will show up here soon</em>).</p>\n<p>As cash flows from standard gold to Bitcoin, the market cap could approach the <em>trillions</em> range. With that order of magnitude of market cap, 1 Bitcoin would have:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Market Capitalization</th>\n<th>Bitcoin price*</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1 Trillion</td>\n<td>~$55,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 Trillion</td>\n<td>~$111,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 Trillion</td>\n<td>~$167,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>‚Ä¶</td>\n<td>‚Ä¶</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7 Trillion (market cap of gold)</td>\n<td>~$389,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>*(assuming around 18 million Bitcoins - currently 16.7 as of writing this entry - it‚Äôs accurate enough as of this posting in late 2017; the 18th millionth Bitcoin isn‚Äôt expected to be mined until October 9th, 2019 - check out <a href=\"https://medium.com/@frewin.christopher/the-bitcoin-mining-schedule-from-december-18-2017-to-june-8-2020-407db59e69f4\">my post on medium about the mining schedule until the next halving</a>)</p>\n<p>I predict:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$20,000 by January 1st 2018 (update: we already made it for a short period of time on December 17th!)</li>\n<li>$50,000 by end of Q2 2018 (i.e. end of June 2018)</li>\n<li>$100,000 by end of Q4 2018 (i.e. end of December 2018)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>But‚Ä¶ 5 Years Out? 10 Years?</h1>\n<p>So I have a somewhat non-average view of Bitcoin in the long run (5-10 year) time range (yes, things like <a href=\"http://blog.flippening.watch/what-is-the-flippening/\">THE FLIPPENING</a> I think could happen). The world is still getting used to cryptocurrency. However, as soon as that honeymoon period is <em>over</em>, the world should (not as it always does, I know), realize a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin, while first to the cryptocurrency market, is undoubtedly <em>not</em> the best cryptocurrency on the market. Even as I write this post, transaction times are stacking up, and a single transaction costs over $3. And what happens to the miners once mining stop? <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/what-happens-bitcoin-miners-all-coins-mined/\">That‚Äôs still a question where I‚Äôm not totally satisfied what some of the answers are.</a></li>\n<li>Litecoin is a copy of (suprised? look at this <a href=\"https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/commit/4405b78d6059e536c36974088a8ed4d9f0f29898\">fork to litecoin from the bitcoin repository by Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin</a>) sorry, but I don‚Äôt see much innovation there</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other blockchain technologies, like Ethereum, Cosmos, and many more (I have a few personal favorites) have numerous advantages, not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a much larger development team</li>\n<li>a much stronger and active code base</li>\n<li>MUCH faster transaction times (Ether, the next closes coin in market cap, processes about <em>2.5x</em> as many transactions as Bitcoin per day)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once these aspects of the market are noticed, I believe wealth will slowly transfer out of Bitcoin - when and if enough people will decide that Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äòstore of wealth‚Äô could in fact be invested in the next best thing (i.e. coin/token). Perhaps once Bitcoin does reach such towering numbers of 50 - 100K, it‚Äôs purpose as a store of global wealth (note NOT the original purpose of Bitcoin) will be met, and perhaps the demand for transactions will taper off. On the other hand, perhaps even a better option for storing wealth in a blockchain could appear. With the rate of speed the tech is moving, its impossible to say, again, only time will tell.</p>\n<p>But, for the present, let the following stand:</p>\n<p><strong>As of 16:08 UTC, Tuesday December 12, 2017 the mid-market price on GDAX for 1 Bitcoin was $17,450.</strong></p>\n<h1>My Conclusions</h1>\n<p>My overall thoughts are this: Bitcoin will continue to see a run up into very large numbers in the 50K-100K region, then stabilize as buying rates finally settle down to match that of selling rates. Then, at some point along this stagnation, there will be a slow starting decrease downtrend in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, then accelerating, bringing the price of Bitcoin back to its pre-boom levels (think: $5 - $10 range). When will this happen? I would say not within the next 5-10 years. But it‚Äôs my long term feeling.</p>\n<p>Cheers! üç∫</p>"}]}
