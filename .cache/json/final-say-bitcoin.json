While this blog will (rest assured) remain about software development and programming, I had to give my final say (barring what a spew on reddit :) ) SOMEWHERE about bitcoin, and let me promise you, I won’t post about Bitcoin (in relation to politics or economics) every again.</p>\n<p>The simple economics are: there will only every 21 million of them, it was the first of its kind (certainly not the best - many improvements in other coins and blockchain protocols exist). But the fact still stands, bitcoin has the largest AND majority market cap among all the other currencies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>A comic I thought up about Bitcoin :)</p>\n<p>As cash flows from standard gold to Bitcoin, the market cap could approach the <em>trillions</em> range. With that order of magnitude of market cap, 1 Bitcoin would have:</p>\n<p>Market Capitalization | Bitcoin price*\n1 Trillion | ~$53,000\n2 Trillion | ~$105,000\n3 Trillion | ~$158,000\n… |\n7 Trillion (market cap of gold) | ~$368,000</p>\n<p>*(assume around 19 million bitcoins - currently 16.7 as of writing this entry)</p>\n<p>I predict:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$20,000 by January 1st 2018</li>\n<li>$50,000 by end of Q2 2018</li>\n<li>$100,000 by end of Q4 2018</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Here’s what has to happen for the price of Bitcoin to crash</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Actually, if 100% of people who bought became true 100% hodlers, the price would remain constant</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let it stand as a permanant marker:</p>\n<p><strong>as of 16:08 UTC, Tuesday december 12, 2017 the mid-market price on GDAX for 1 Bitcoin was $17,450.</strong></p>",
