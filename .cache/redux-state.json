How did I do it?\n\nI wrote a `window.setInterval()` function that would ping table `/SCWM/WT` 😊 and check for any new lines - with an OData `GET_ENTITY_SET` server request. 😊 😊\n\nYeah.\n\nWell, I was lucky to learn about websockets from one of our EWM. Then I was even luckier to learn a bit more about the technical aspects (when to subscribe, unsubscribe, destroy, and create websockets instances from actions on the front end).\n\nSo here's how to add websockets to your SAPUI5 app<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\">1</a></sup>.\n\n## Transactions\n\nAll backend push and messaging channels can be managed with just two transactions:  `SAMC`, for message channels and `SAPC`, for push channels. Easy enough.\n\n## Creating a Message Channel\n\nAs we will see, to create a proper push channel, we will first need a message channel, so that is where we start off. An ABAP message channel is a way of subscribing current programs to any - the best thing about push channels is that if the push channel _isn't_ listening, there is no error and nothing else negative happens anywhere else in the system - that is, granted you `TRY` and `CATCH` your push channel messaging properly.\n\nSo let's get started in transaction `SAMC`:\n\n![]()\n\nWe define the message channel name, and, most importantly, define what programs can use this message channel and what type of message this channel will handle (there are only 2 - numeric and string)\n\nNow, as I mention before, we use these channels to hook into any ABAP program, so that any time they are executed by anyone (or anything) in the system, the channel will be messages. A safe way to hook into an existing program (using our newly created `Z_AWESOME_CHANNEL`) looks as follows:\n\n```abap\nREPORT my_super_cool_existing_report\n\n\n\n```\n\n## Creating a Push Channel\n\nOk, now we head to transaction `SAPC` - we are no going to define a websocket that will be hooked up to our push channel. That way, when something happens in our program, it will message to all subscribed channels, which will be forwarded , and then ultimately, to the most important part, the frontend for our user to see!\n\n## Frontend\n\nOn the frontend I create a general websocket function that creates a websocket instance. In order to have the correct service for each view, upon each view change I call this function, which always creates a new instance if there exists a websocket instance already. This way we are sure that on any view change, we have a fresh running instance of the websocket doing the correct task for this view.\n\nThat function looks like this:\n\n```\n\n```\n\nNote that you of course have to us `ws://` as the protocol in the link name!\n\nOn the backend, that ends up looking like a `CASE` statement:\n\n```abap\nCASE\n```\n\n## Code\n\nYep, you're going to have to write some ABAP code too. Luckily for us, when we create a push channel in transaction SAPC, SAP generates a class skeleton with 4 methods:\n\n``\n``\n``\n``\n``\n\n<hr/>\n\n# Footnotes\n<div id=\"footnote-1\">\n1.

This username is your SAP 's' username, an 's' followed by 10 numbers, i.e. `S0123456789`.\n\n## TL;DR: Gimme Code!\n\nThe full code (as of January 11, 2018) is as follows:\n\n```javascript\n// ==UserScript==\n// @name         Monokai Web IDE colors\n// @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/\n// @version      1.0\n// @description  Changes the Ace Shell CSS in SAP Web IDE from any defaults to Monokai.\n// @author       Chris Frewin\n// @match        https://webide-[YOUR_USER_NAME_HERE]trial.dispatcher.hanatrial.ondemand.com\n// @grant        GM_getResourceText\n// @grant        GM_addStyle\n// @resource     customCSS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajaxorg/ace/master/lib/ace/theme/monokai.css\n// @require      http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.6.0/highlight.min.js\n// @require      http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js\n// ==/UserScript==\n\n// *** NOTE: feel free to replace the 'customCSS' link above with any of the following ace themes found here: (make sure to select the raw version!)\n// https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/tree/master/lib/ace/theme\n\nwindow.setTimeout(function() {\n    var newCSS = GM_getResourceText (\"customCSS\"); // monokai css for ace editor\n    GM_addStyle (newCSS);\n    console.log(\"added css...\");\n    var editor = $(\"#__editor0\"); // select editor ID\n    $(editor).removeClass(); // remove any of the default classes\n    console.log(\"removed default css...\");\n    $(editor).addClass(\"ace_editor\"); // add back in original class\n    $(editor).addClass(\"ace-monokai\"); // monokai colors class!\n    console.log(\"added ace-monokai css...\");\n},20000);\n```\n\nI would recommend you check out the newest version on GitHub: [https://github.com/frewinchristopher/sapwebidecolors](https://github.com/frewinchristopher/sapwebidecolors)\n\nCheers! :beer:\n",

You can see how to do this in <a href=\"#footnote-6\">footnote 6</a> for more._\n\n_Edit April 19th, 2018:_\n\n_There was a bug with this code! When we make the conversion to MIN, we forgot to overwrite_ `lv_unit` _to_ `MIN`_, so the conversion was correct, but the unit was left in hours, or_ `H` _! You can see this in the code comments with date 2018.04.19._\n\n# First off, Congratulations! 🎊\n<sup>And a happy new year! (If you're viewing this in the summer or something, see the date! 😉)</sup>\n## You've found the only post on the entire internet that describes the full process of calculating activity amounts for production order confirmations by programming it directly using SAP ABAP! 😱😱😱\n## I hope you use this post to maximum effectiveness, because it took me _four_ days to find, build, and get a working answer. 😄\n\n## The Problem\n\nLet's jump right into ABAP programming: the go-to function module to calculate time ticket proposals for production orders is with function module `BAPI_PRODORDCONF_GET_TT_PROP`:\n\n```abap\nCALL FUNCTION 'BAPI_PRODORDCONF_GET_TT_PROP'\n* EXPORTING\n*   PROPOSE                  = ' '\n* IMPORTING\n*   RETURN                   =\n  TABLES\n    timetickets              =\n*   GOODSMOVEMENTS           =\n*   LINK_CONF_GOODSMOV       =\n*   DETAIL_RETURN            =\n          .\n```\n\nLikewise, there is a very similiar `BAPI_PROCORDCONF_GET_TT_PROP` for process orders:\n\n```abap\nCALL FUNCTION 'BAPI_PROCORDCONF_GET_TT_PROP'\n* EXPORTING\n*   PROPOSE                  = ' '\n* IMPORTING\n*   RETURN                   =\n  TABLES\n    timetickets              =\n*   GOODSMOVEMENTS           =\n*   LINK_CONF_GOODSMOV       =\n*   DETAIL_RETURN            =\n          .\n```\n\nPretty similar. However, as part of my indentured servitude that is being a full-time employee, I spent a day tinkering, writing, and testing code with these function modules. No matter what combinations of inputs I provided, I couldn't get the _activity confirmation amount_ to be calculated, which are a very important part of the final calculation of the confirmation! (more on the actual final confirmation submission is also included in later on) From scrounging around on SCN and the SAP blog, I learned that many developers had the same issue with these functions. (Things like date, yield/scrap amounts, and the goods movements would be proposed just fine by these BAPIs.)\n\nSo, **calculating these activity confirmation amounts programmatically (in ABAP) will be the main focus of this post <sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\">1</a></sup>.**\n\nUnfortunately, with much more digging, the reason the two functions wouldn't produce activity confirmation amounts never became quite clear to me. I realized I would have to calculate them in a more manual manner and then add them to those BAPI structures `lt_timetickets` manually.\n\n## The Calculation Function Module\n\nThrough SAP GUI in transaction `CO11N`, determining system-proposed confirmation amounts is easy enough by and asking the system to do the calculation for us <sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\">2</a></sup>. My struggle was finding the programmatic way to do this in ABAP.\n\nAnyone with significant production planning experience (i.e., not me 😂 ) knows that the actual formula behind the activity calculation is not with the activity itself, but with the work center _behind_ the activity <sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\">3</a></sup>.\n\nIn transaction `CR03` (display work center), in the 'Costing' Tab, there is a 'Formula' button with the check symbol on it:\n\n![GUI testing calculation](./test-formula.jpg)\n\nThis was my starting point to find any sort of function that could do this programmatically - with more time, I learned from SCN of a function that does exactly that! It's called `CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC`!\n\nLet's head on over to transaction `SE37` and test it ourselves!\n\n![Yep, that's SAP](./error-test-frame.jpg)\n\n😑😑😑 shit... SAP, you had one job to do!\n\nFine. We'll do it ourselves. We can open up the source code of `CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC` and set a breakpoint in the first line:\n\n![The first possible line in the function we can breakpoint](./function-breakpoint.png)\n\nand in CR03, drag our [debugging shortcut into the calculation window](https://chrisfrew.in/debugging-abap-with-sap-shortcut), and we press return SAP debugging's return button to jump out to whatever parent program is calling this function... <img src=\"return.png\"/> and...\n\n🙏 Violá! 🙏 We've found where `CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC` is called out in the wild!\n\n![There you are `CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC`](./function-found.png)\n\n(For those deeply interested, you can find exactly where the function is called in SAP Program `SAPLCRA0`, Include `LCRA0F71`, line 55, at least for SAPGUI 740.)\n\n![Calling program details](./form-program.png)\n\n## The Details (The Hard Part)\n\nSo what the heck does SAP do with this function? Well, first, they are doing a do loop six times. Aha, we know why - because there can be a total of six confirmation values <sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\">4</a></sup>  - SAP is by default looping over all of them.\n\nNow for the function parameters themselves: they pass the work center code (`arbid`), the operation number (`rcrop`), the index of the confirmation (a value of 1-6), our 4 default values (`vgw`), and the date (`date`).\n\nIn turn, the function spits out the fixed value amount of the activity calculation (`value_fix`), the variable part (`value_var`), both in whatever unit the function gives out in `unit`, and `co_a` is for the cost center accounting <sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\">5</a></sup>. There are actually four exceptions to this function, so I'm not sure why SAP internal is taking only two of them. In any case, there are other `IMPORTING` and `EXPORTING` parameters in the function signature, but this looks like a good starting point as a minimum. In fact, as you'll see below, the final working version of the code I created is almost exactly the same except where I found out with a bit of playing around.\n\nSo I mentioned the default values that must go into `vgw` - these are the four values that are the equivalent of those four fields we can type into in `COR3` for checking the formula, things like setup time, machine time, personnel setup, and personnel time. It might sound like a lot of work to hunt down these values, but luckily these are master data and can be determined with a few select statements, first from table `AFVC` 'operation within an order', and then table `PLPO` 'task list - operation/activity':\n\n```abap\n\" this is the full key for table AFVC - operation within an order - for the routing number and counter - should always work with SELECT SINGLE\nSELECT SINGLE * FROM afvc INTO ls_afvc\n  WHERE aufpl = ls_operation-routing_no\n  AND   aplzl = ls_operation-counter.\n\n\" this is the full key for table PLPO - task list - operation/activity - so it should always work with SELECT SINGLE\nSELECT SINGLE * FROM plpo INTO ls_plpo\n  WHERE plnty EQ ls_afvc-plnty\n  AND plnnr EQ ls_afvc-plnnr\n  AND plnkn EQ ls_afvc-plnkn\n  AND zaehl EQ ls_afvc-zaehl.\n```\n\nThe routing number `ls_operation-routing_no` and counter `ls_operation-counter` we've gotten from function `BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL`:\n\n```abap\n\" need only the operations from the function\n    ls_order_objects-operations = 'X'.\n    lv_number = ls_orderid_so-low.\n\n    CALL FUNCTION 'BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL'\n      EXPORTING\n        number        = lv_number\n*       COLLECTIVE_ORDER       =\n        order_objects = ls_order_objects\n*     IMPORTING\n*       RETURN        =\n      TABLES\n*       HEADER        =\n*       POSITION      =\n*       SEQUENCE      =\n        operation     = lt_operation\n*       TRIGGER_POINT =\n*       COMPONENT     =\n*       PROD_REL_TOOL =\n      .\n```\n\n(There is plenty of SAP standard documentation and discussion on SCN on how to use `BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL`, so I'll leave that to you if you need more info 😉. Here we are just getting the operation information from the order - that's all we need.)\n\nWe can finally move the corresponding fields of `ls_plpo` to `ls_vgw`:\n\n```abap\nMOVE-CORRESPONDING ls_plpo TO ls_vgw.\n```\n\nHowever, in addition to these four values, there are two more that are essential, that is the yield amount (`mgvrg`), and the unit (`meinh`)! We can pass them right into `ls_op` as well:\n\n```abap\nMOVE-CORRESPONDING ls_plpo TO ls_op.\nls_op-mgvrg = ls_yield_so-low.\nls_op-meinh = ls_conf_quan_unit_so-low.\n```\n\nArmed with our structures `ls_afvc`, `ls_op`, and `ls_vgw`, we are ready to call our function:\n\n```abap\nCALL FUNCTION 'CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC' \" You can see a SAP standard example with the function in the source code for transaction CR03 for costing formula: Program SAPLCRA0, Include LCRA0F71, Form FORMEL_RESULT_CALC, line 55\n  EXPORTING\n    arbid             = ls_afvc-arbid\n    op                = ls_op\n    vgw               = ls_vgw\n    index             = sy-index\n    date              = sy-datum\n  IMPORTING\n    value_fix          = lv_value_fix\n    value_var         = lv_value_var\n    unit              = lv_unit\n  EXCEPTIONS\n    missing_parameter = 1\n    not_found         = 2\n    division_by_zero  = 3\n    OTHERS            = 4.\nIF sy-subrc <> 0.\n  CONCATENATE sy-msgno sy-msgid sy-msgv1 sy-msgv2 sy-msgv3 sy-msgv4 INTO es_entityset-error_message.\n  APPEND es_entityset TO et_entityset.\nENDIF.\n```\n\nWe want the total, right? Okay, we just add the fixed value and variable value part:\n\n```abap\nlv_value = lv_value_fix + lv_value_var. \" total value is the sum of the fixed and variable values for this activity\n```\n\nA requirement by my company was to have all the activity confirmation values with the same unit (I find it cleaner anyway to have all the activity confirmation values in the same unit anyway). Unfortunately, the default unit for some of the activities was hours, so we have to take a small intermediary step and call a conversion function before we are truly done:\n\n```abap\n\" convert any 'H' values to 'MIN'\nIF lv_unit NE 'MIN'.\n  CALL FUNCTION 'UNIT_CONVERSION_SIMPLE'\n    EXPORTING\n      input                = lv_value\n      unit_in              = lv_unit\n      unit_out             = 'MIN'\n    IMPORTING\n      output               = lv_output\n    EXCEPTIONS\n      conversion_not_found = 1\n      division_by_zero     = 2\n      input_invalid        = 3\n      output_invalid       = 4\n      overflow              = 5\n      type_invalid         = 6\n      units_missing        = 7\n      unit_in_not_found    = 8\n      unit_out_not_found   = 9\n      OTHERS               = 10.\n  IF sy-subrc <> 0.\n    lo_logger->create_message( EXPORTING iv_log_handle = lv_log_handle iv_message = '' ). \" add custom message to message log\n    CONCATENATE sy-msgno sy-msgid sy-msgv1 sy-msgv2 sy-msgv3 sy-msgv4 INTO es_entityset-error_message.\n    APPEND es_entityset TO et_entityset.\n  ENDIF.\n```\nWe then finally carry over this converted `lv_output` over to the `conf_activity` field for `lt_timetickets`, doing this for all 1-6 `conf_activity`'s:\n\n```abap\nCASE sy-index.\n  WHEN 1.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_activity1  = lv_output.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit1 = 'MIN'.\n  WHEN 2.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_activity2  = lv_output.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit2 = 'MIN'.\n  WHEN 3.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_activity3  = lv_output.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit3 = 'MIN'.\n  WHEN 4.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_activity4  = lv_output.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit4 = 'MIN'.\n  WHEN 5.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_activity5  = lv_output.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit5 = 'MIN'.\n  WHEN 6.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_activity6  = lv_output.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit6 = 'MIN'.\nENDCASE.\n```\n\nWith that, we can call the final confirmation function, with all our calculated values wrapped up in `lt_timetickets`:\n\n```abap\n\" create confirmation\nCALL FUNCTION 'BAPI_PRODORDCONF_CREATE_TT'\n*     EXPORTING\n*       POST_WRONG_ENTRIES             = '0'\n*       TESTRUN                        =\n*       CALL_ON_INBOUND_QUEUE          = ' '\n  IMPORTING\n    return         = ls_return\n  TABLES\n    timetickets    = lt_timetickets\n    goodsmovements = lt_goodsmovements\n*       LINK_CONF_GOODSMOV             =\n*       CHARACTERISTICS_WIPBATCH       =\n*       LINK_CONF_CHAR_WIPBATCH        =\n    detail_return  = lt_detail_return\n*       CHARACTERISTICS_BATCH          =\n*       LINK_GM_CHAR_BATCH             =\n  EXCEPTIONS\n    OTHERS         = 1.\nIF sy-subrc <> 0.\n  lo_logger->create_message( EXPORTING iv_log_handle = lv_log_handle iv_message = '' ). \" add custom message to message log\n  CONCATENATE sy-msgno sy-msgid sy-msgv1 sy-msgv2 sy-msgv3 sy-msgv4 INTO es_entityset-error_message.\n  APPEND es_entityset TO et_entityset.\nENDIF.\n```\nIf you were sharp, you realized all of this code is only on the operation level - so indeed, the six-level loop must be done each time, for each operation - we have to throw all the above code into a loop over our operations! See below for the full result!\n\n## Production Orders\nIn summary, the full code looks like this:\n\n**NOTE: the full code examples were written for a SAP Gateway environment - i.e. the server environment from a SAPUI5 OData call! If you try to copy and paste this code directly into something like a report or function, ABAP statements like:**\n\n```abap\nlt_filters = io_tech_request_context->get_filter( )->get_filter_select_options( ).\n```\n\nwon't be in scope and won't compile without errors! However, if you are familiar with the CRUD based methods of the SAP Gateway backend, these will fit nicely into the `GET_ENTITYSET` method 😄\n\n```abap\nDATA : lt_filters           TYPE

Here is a summary of some of those name and type changes:\n\n<hr/>\n\n| Topic | Production Orders | Process Orders |\n| ------- | ----------------- | -------------- |\n| Name of the 'steps' in your process or production order | phase/activity (I've seen both names, ABAP uses mostly 'phase') | operation |\n| Get order detail of order | `BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL` | `BAPI_PROCORD_GET_DETAIL` |\n| detail of order 'step' type | `bapi_order_phase`  |  `bapi_order_operation1` |\n| Function for timeticket proposals | `BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL` | `BAPI_PROCORD_GET_DETAIL` |\n| Function for order confirmation | `BAPI_PRODORDCONF_CREATE_TT` | `BAPI_PROCORDCONF_CREATE_TT` |\n| `timetickets` `TYPE` in order confirmation function | `bapi_pp_timeticket` | `bapi_pi_timeticket1` |\n\n<hr/>\n\nThere are more, but you can find those in the code for yourself. The important thing to notice is that the key challenging part here, calculating the confirmation activity amounts, uses the same internal function module, ``\n\nHere's the code for calculating activities for process orders - _note the slight change in all the variable names!_ - and be careful with your types (carefully look over the `DATA:` statement), otherwise you'll get 💥**exploding runtime errors**💥 when you try to confirm something with one of our two main functions and you pass, for example, the  `lt_timetickets` with the production type ``, and you pass it into the of the _process_ order function module.\n\n```abap\n  DATA : lt_filters           TYPE           /iwbep/t_mgw_select_option,\n         ls_filters           LIKE LINE OF lt_filters,\n

Comments\n\nWhew. Did it feel like a marathon? :runner: Because it felt to _me_ like a marathon all that time I was scratching my head. I hope you all enjoyed and found this post useful for a not-so-often programmed function of this production planning section of SAP.\n\nAnother note and quick plug 😄 I hope everyone can appreciate the time I put into creating these posts (_hint:_ posts this long take a **LONG** time to write!). It would make me happy and give me the motivation to keep writing these detailed ABAP posts if you'd consider donating (in the footer of any page on this blog) I have a [PayPal.me link](https://www.paypal.me/chrisfrewin), and I'm also an Ethereum developer if you'd like to donate Ether or if you would like to donate some RaiBlocks, as I am a RaiBlocks enthusiast if you would prefer to donate in that way.\n\n💩 Ok, plug done! 💩\n\nCheers! 🍺\n\n<hr/>\n\n# Footnotes\n\n<div id=\"footnote-1\">\n1. Activities/phases are for production orders; Operations are for process orders. From this point onward, I will refer just to activities, since this post focuses on production orders. I also post the adjacent code for process orders in this post.\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"footnote-2\">\n2. I have to give credit where credit is due! I received a lot of assistance from our production planning module supervisor - he showed me the transactions that finally got me to a working result. 👍\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"footnote-3\">\n3. You can set up your production planning (PP) module to give you a proposal amount for the activities, directly when you are doing confirmations transaction <span style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">CO11N</span>:\n\nUpon pressing 'enter' for with a new amount:\n![Automatic calculation of confirmation activities by the System in transaction CO11N](./co11n-1.jpg)\n\nPressing 'OK' for this window, we get a popup:\n\n![Filling confirmation activities by hand in transaction CO11N](./co11n-2.jpg)\n\nWe see that the Labor time is provided here. It's likely 30 min for a full 100 KG, since the system is proposing only 15 minutes for 50 KG, half of what the full order amount should be. (I know, it's not a full four field example - but values would also be proposed if you had more fields like machine time, machine set-up, etc.)\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"footnote-4\">\n4. Note: At my company, we usually use only up to four confirmation activities. Note that there can be up to six, but for this example, we'll say that the confirmation process has only a maximum of four.\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"footnote-5\">\n5. I ended up determining that you can exclude parameter `co_a` without any issues - however, this may be how the settings at my own company work - you can look deeper into the SAP example to include it.\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"footnote-6\">\n6. This issue does not affect the confirmation formulas, but rather the goods movements in the retrograde ingredients - specifically when the goods movements are to be overridden, for example with a batch split for a retrograde material, or a custom under- or over- amount of a retrograde material. For the rare case where an employee wanted to book some of our retrograde materials from various batch numbers and warehouse locations, they noticed in these custom goods movements with the confirmation were not being added; but rather always the default SAP-calculated amounts. After some head scratching, I found it all has to do with function module <span style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">BAPI_PRODORDCONF_CREATE_TT</span> (or <span style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">BAPI_PROCORDCONF_CREATE_TT</span> depending on your use case) - I was not passing in an important parameter which allows exactly this desired override behavior:\n\n<pre>\nLinkConfGoodsmov\nThe assignment of the goods movements to a confirmation is effected\nvia the LinkConfGoodsmov table. There must be an entry in this table\nfor every entry in the Goodsmovements table. The index in the\nLinkConfGoodsmov-Index_Confirm field refers to the line of the\nassociated confirmation in the Timetickets table and the index in\nthe LinkConfGoodsmov-Index_Goodsmov field refers the associated\ngoods movement in the Goodsmovements table.\nIf you want to prevent a goods movement from being posted for a\nconfirmation according to the standard logic, make an entry in the\nLinkConfGoodsmov table as well as in the Timetickets table. The\nindex in the LinkConfGoodsmov-Index_Confirm field refers to the line\nof the associated confirmation in the Timetickets table. Enter the\ninitial value 0 in the LinkConfGoodsmov-Index_Goodsmov field. It is\nnot necessary to make an entry in the Goodsmovements table in this\ncase.\nIf there is no entry in the LinkConfGoodsmov table for a\nconfirmation, goods movements are determined for backflushing and\nautomatic goods receipt using the standard logic.\n</pre>\n\nWe needed to add the following too our goods movements loop (already added in the code above! 😄):\n\n```abap\nBLAH\n```\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n",

There is something you need to add if you want to book custom goods movements for the retrograde materials. You can see how to do this in <a href=\"#footnote-6\">footnote 6</a> for more._\n\n_Edit April 19th, 2018:_\n\n_There was a bug with this code! When we make the conversion to MIN, we forgot to overwrite_ `lv_unit` _to_ `MIN`_, so the conversion was correct, but the unit was left in hours, or_ `H` _! You can see this in the code comments with date 2018.04.19._\n\n# First off, Congratulations! :confetti_ball:\n<sup>And a happy new year! (If you're viewing this in the summer or something, see the date! :wink:)</sup>\n## You've found the only post on the entire internet that describes the full process of calculating activity amounts for production order confirmations by programming it directly using SAP ABAP! :scream::scream::scream:\n## I hope you use this post to maximum effectiveness, because it took me _four_ days to find, build, and get a working answer. :smile:\n\n## The Problem\n\nLet's jump right into ABAP programming: the go-to function module to calculate time ticket proposals for production orders is with function module `BAPI_PRODORDCONF_GET_TT_PROP`:\n\n```abap\nCALL FUNCTION 'BAPI_PRODORDCONF_GET_TT_PROP'\n* EXPORTING\n*   PROPOSE                  = ' '\n* IMPORTING\n*   RETURN                   =\n  TABLES\n    timetickets              =\n*   GOODSMOVEMENTS           =\n*   LINK_CONF_GOODSMOV       =\n*   DETAIL_RETURN            =\n          .\n```\n\nLikewise, there is a very similiar `BAPI_PROCORDCONF_GET_TT_PROP` for process orders:\n\n```abap\nCALL FUNCTION 'BAPI_PROCORDCONF_GET_TT_PROP'\n* EXPORTING\n*   PROPOSE                  = ' '\n* IMPORTING\n*   RETURN                   =\n  TABLES\n    timetickets              =\n*   GOODSMOVEMENTS           =\n*   LINK_CONF_GOODSMOV       =\n*   DETAIL_RETURN            =\n          .\n```\n\nPretty similar. However, as part of my indentured servitude that is being a full-time employee, I spent a day tinkering, writing, and testing code with these function modules. No matter what combinations of inputs I provided, I couldn't get the _activity confirmation amount_ to be calculated, which are a very important part of the final calculation of the confirmation! (more on the actual final confirmation submission is also included in later on) From scrounging around on SCN and the SAP blog, I learned that many developers had the same issue with these functions. (Things like date, yield/scrap amounts, and the goods movements would be proposed just fine by these BAPIs.)\n\nSo, **calculating these activity confirmation amounts programmatically (in ABAP) will be the main focus of this post <sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\">1</a></sup>.**\n\nUnfortunately, with much more digging, the reason the two functions wouldn't produce activity confirmation amounts never became quite clear to me. I realized I would have to calculate them in a more manual manner and then add them to those BAPI structures `lt_timetickets` manually.\n\n## The Calculation Function Module\n\nThrough SAP GUI in transaction `CO11N`, determining system-proposed confirmation amounts is easy enough by and asking the system to do the calculation for us <sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\">2</a></sup>. My struggle was finding the programmatic way to do this in ABAP.\n\nAnyone with significant production planning experience (i.e., not me :joy: ) knows that the actual formula behind the activity calculation is not with the activity itself, but with the work center _behind_ the activity <sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\">3</a></sup>.\n\nIn transaction `CR03` (display work center), in the 'Costing' Tab, there is a 'Formula' button with the check symbol on it:\n\n![GUI testing calculation](./test-formula.jpg)\n\nThis was my starting point to find any sort of function that could do this programmatically - with more time, I learned from SCN of a function that does exactly that! It's called `CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC`!\n\nLet's head on over to transaction `SE37` and test it ourselves!\n\n![Yep, that's SAP](./error-test-frame.jpg)\n\n:expressionless::expressionless::expressionless: shit... SAP, you had one job to do!\n\nFine. We'll do it ourselves. We can open up the source code of `CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC` and set a breakpoint in the first line:\n\n![The first possible line in the function we can breakpoint](./function-breakpoint.png)\n\nand in CR03, drag our [debugging shortcut into the calculation window](https://chrisfrew.in/debugging-abap-with-sap-shortcut), and we press return SAP debugging's return button to jump out to whatever parent program is calling this function... <img src=\"return.png\"/> and...\n\n:pray: Violá! :pray: We've found where `CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC` is called out in the wild!\n\n![There you are `CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC`](./function-found.png)\n\n(For those deeply interested, you can find exactly where the function is called in SAP Program `SAPLCRA0`, Include `LCRA0F71`, line 55, at least for SAPGUI 740.)\n\n![Calling program details](./form-program.png)\n\n## The Details (The Hard Part)\n\nSo what the heck does SAP do with this function? Well, first, they are doing a do loop six times. Aha, we know why - because there can be a total of six confirmation values <sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\">4</a></sup>  - SAP is by default looping over all of them.\n\nNow for the function parameters themselves: they pass the work center code (`arbid`), the operation number (`rcrop`), the index of the confirmation (a value of 1-6), our 4 default values (`vgw`), and the date (`date`).\n\nIn turn, the function spits out the fixed value amount of the activity calculation (`value_fix`), the variable part (`value_var`), both in whatever unit the function gives out in `unit`, and `co_a` is for the cost center accounting <sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\">5</a></sup>. There are actually four exceptions to this function, so I'm not sure why SAP internal is taking only two of them. In any case, there are other `IMPORTING` and `EXPORTING` parameters in the function signature, but this looks like a good starting point as a minimum. In fact, as you'll see below, the final working version of the code I created is almost exactly the same except where I found out with a bit of playing around.\n\nSo I mentioned the default values that must go into `vgw` - these are the four values that are the equivalent of those four fields we can type into in `COR3` for checking the formula, things like setup time, machine time, personnel setup, and personnel time. It might sound like a lot of work to hunt down these values, but luckily these are master data and can be determined with a few select statements, first from table `AFVC` 'operation within an order', and then table `PLPO` 'task list - operation/activity':\n\n```abap\n\" this is the full key for table AFVC - operation within an order - for the routing number and counter - should always work with SELECT SINGLE\nSELECT SINGLE * FROM afvc INTO ls_afvc\n  WHERE aufpl = ls_operation-routing_no\n  AND   aplzl = ls_operation-counter.\n\n\" this is the full key for table PLPO - task list - operation/activity - so it should always work with SELECT SINGLE\nSELECT SINGLE * FROM plpo INTO ls_plpo\n  WHERE plnty EQ ls_afvc-plnty\n  AND plnnr EQ ls_afvc-plnnr\n  AND plnkn EQ ls_afvc-plnkn\n  AND zaehl EQ ls_afvc-zaehl.\n```\n\nThe routing number `ls_operation-routing_no` and counter `ls_operation-counter` we've gotten from function `BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL`:\n\n```abap\n\" need only the operations from the function\n    ls_order_objects-operations = 'X'.\n    lv_number = ls_orderid_so-low.\n\n    CALL FUNCTION 'BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL'\n      EXPORTING\n        number        = lv_number\n*       COLLECTIVE_ORDER       =\n        order_objects = ls_order_objects\n*     IMPORTING\n*       RETURN        =\n      TABLES\n*       HEADER        =\n*       POSITION      =\n*       SEQUENCE      =\n        operation     = lt_operation\n*       TRIGGER_POINT =\n*       COMPONENT     =\n*       PROD_REL_TOOL =\n      .\n```\n\n(There is plenty of SAP standard documentation and discussion on SCN on how to use `BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL`, so I'll leave that to you if you need more info :wink:. Here we are just getting the operation information from the order - that's all we need.)\n\nWe can finally move the corresponding fields of `ls_plpo` to `ls_vgw`:\n\n```abap\nMOVE-CORRESPONDING ls_plpo TO ls_vgw.\n```\n\nHowever, in addition to these four values, there are two more that are essential, that is the yield amount (`mgvrg`), and the unit (`meinh`)! We can pass them right into `ls_op` as well:\n\n```abap\nMOVE-CORRESPONDING ls_plpo TO ls_op.\nls_op-mgvrg = ls_yield_so-low.\nls_op-meinh = ls_conf_quan_unit_so-low.\n```\n\nArmed with our structures `ls_afvc`, `ls_op`, and `ls_vgw`, we are ready to call our function:\n\n```abap\nCALL FUNCTION 'CR_WORKCENTER_FORMULA_CALC' \" You can see a SAP standard example with the function in the source code for transaction CR03 for costing formula: Program SAPLCRA0, Include LCRA0F71, Form FORMEL_RESULT_CALC, line 55\n  EXPORTING\n    arbid             = ls_afvc-arbid\n    op                = ls_op\n    vgw               = ls_vgw\n    index             = sy-index\n    date              = sy-datum\n  IMPORTING\n    value_fix          = lv_value_fix\n    value_var         = lv_value_var\n    unit              = lv_unit\n  EXCEPTIONS\n    missing_parameter = 1\n    not_found         = 2\n    division_by_zero  = 3\n    OTHERS            = 4.\nIF sy-subrc <> 0.\n  CONCATENATE sy-msgno sy-msgid sy-msgv1 sy-msgv2 sy-msgv3 sy-msgv4 INTO es_entityset-error_message.\n  APPEND es_entityset TO et_entityset.\nENDIF.\n```\n\nWe want the total, right? Okay, we just add the fixed value and variable value part:\n\n```abap\nlv_value = lv_value_fix + lv_value_var. \" total value is the sum of the fixed and variable values for this activity\n```\n\nA requirement by my company was to have all the activity confirmation values with the same unit (I find it cleaner anyway to have all the activity confirmation values in the same unit anyway). Unfortunately, the default unit for some of the activities was hours, so we have to take a small intermediary step and call a conversion function before we are truly done:\n\n```abap\n\" convert any 'H' values to 'MIN'\nIF lv_unit NE 'MIN'.\n  CALL FUNCTION 'UNIT_CONVERSION_SIMPLE'\n    EXPORTING\n      input                = lv_value\n      unit_in              = lv_unit\n      unit_out             = 'MIN'\n    IMPORTING\n      output               = lv_output\n    EXCEPTIONS\n      conversion_not_found = 1\n      division_by_zero     = 2\n      input_invalid        = 3\n      output_invalid       = 4\n      overflow              = 5\n      type_invalid         = 6\n      units_missing        = 7\n      unit_in_not_found    = 8\n      unit_out_not_found   = 9\n      OTHERS               = 10.\n  IF sy-subrc <> 0.\n    lo_logger->create_message( EXPORTING iv_log_handle = lv_log_handle iv_message = '' ). \" add custom message to message log\n    CONCATENATE sy-msgno sy-msgid sy-msgv1 sy-msgv2 sy-msgv3 sy-msgv4 INTO es_entityset-error_message.\n    APPEND es_entityset TO et_entityset.\n  ENDIF.\n```\nWe then finally carry over this converted `lv_output` over to the `conf_activity` field for `lt_timetickets`, doing this for all 1-6 `conf_activity`'s:\n\n```abap\nCASE sy-index.\n  WHEN 1.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_activity1  = lv_output.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit1 = 'MIN'.\n  WHEN 2.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_activity2  = lv_output.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit2 = 'MIN'.\n  WHEN 3.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_activity3  = lv_output.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit3 = 'MIN'.\n  WHEN 4.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_activity4  = lv_output.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit4 = 'MIN'.\n  WHEN 5.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_activity5  = lv_output.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit5 = 'MIN'.\n  WHEN 6.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_activity6  = lv_output.\n    ls_timetickets-conf_acti_unit6 = 'MIN'.\nENDCASE.\n```\n\nWith that, we can call the final confirmation function, with all our calculated values wrapped up in `lt_timetickets`:\n\n```abap\n\" create confirmation\nCALL FUNCTION 'BAPI_PRODORDCONF_CREATE_TT'\n*     EXPORTING\n*       POST_WRONG_ENTRIES             = '0'\n*       TESTRUN                        =\n*       CALL_ON_INBOUND_QUEUE          = ' '\n  IMPORTING\n    return         = ls_return\n  TABLES\n    timetickets    = lt_timetickets\n    goodsmovements = lt_goodsmovements\n*       LINK_CONF_GOODSMOV             =\n*       CHARACTERISTICS_WIPBATCH       =\n*       LINK_CONF_CHAR_WIPBATCH        =\n    detail_return  = lt_detail_return\n*       CHARACTERISTICS_BATCH          =\n*       LINK_GM_CHAR_BATCH             =\n  EXCEPTIONS\n    OTHERS         = 1.\nIF sy-subrc <> 0.\n  lo_logger->create_message( EXPORTING iv_log_handle = lv_log_handle iv_message = '' ). \" add custom message to message log\n  CONCATENATE sy-msgno sy-msgid sy-msgv1 sy-msgv2 sy-msgv3 sy-msgv4 INTO es_entityset-error_message.\n  APPEND es_entityset TO et_entityset.\nENDIF.\n```\nIf you were sharp, you realized all of this code is only on the operation level - so indeed, the six-level loop must be done each time, for each operation - we have to throw all the above code into a loop over our operations! See below for the full result!\n\n## Production Orders\nIn summary, the full code looks like this:\n\n**NOTE: the full code examples were written for a SAP Gateway environment - i.e. the server environment from a SAPUI5 OData call! If you try to copy and paste this code directly into something like a report or function, ABAP statements like:**\n\n```abap\nlt_filters = io_tech_request_context->get_filter( )->get_filter_select_options( ).\n```\n\nwon't be in scope and won't compile without errors! However, if you are familiar with the CRUD based methods of the SAP Gateway backend, these will fit nicely into the `GET_ENTITYSET` method :smile:\n\n```abap\nDATA : lt_filters           TYPE

Here is a summary of some of those name and type changes:\n\n<hr/>\n\n| Topic | Production Orders | Process Orders |\n| ------- | ----------------- | -------------- |\n| Name of the 'steps' in your process or production order | phase/activity (I've seen both names, ABAP uses mostly 'phase') | operation |\n| Get order detail of order | `BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL` | `BAPI_PROCORD_GET_DETAIL` |\n| detail of order 'step' type | `bapi_order_phase`  |  `bapi_order_operation1` |\n| Function for timeticket proposals | `BAPI_PRODORD_GET_DETAIL` | `BAPI_PROCORD_GET_DETAIL` |\n| Function for order confirmation | `BAPI_PRODORDCONF_CREATE_TT` | `BAPI_PROCORDCONF_CREATE_TT` |\n| `timetickets` `TYPE` in order confirmation function | `bapi_pp_timeticket` | `bapi_pi_timeticket1` |\n\n<hr/>\n\nThere are more, but you can find those in the code for yourself. The important thing to notice is that the key challenging part here, calculating the confirmation activity amounts, uses the same internal function module, ``\n\nHere's the code for calculating activities for process orders - _note the slight change in all the variable names!_ - and be careful with your types (carefully look over the `DATA:` statement), otherwise you'll get :boom:**exploding runtime errors**:boom: when you try to confirm something with one of our two main functions and you pass, for example, the  `lt_timetickets` with the production type ``, and you pass it into the of the _process_ order function module.\n\n```abap\n  DATA : lt_filters           TYPE           /iwbep/t_mgw_select_option,\n         ls_filters           LIKE LINE OF lt_filters,\n

Comments\n\nWhew. Did it feel like a marathon? :runner: Because it felt to _me_ like a marathon all that time I was scratching my head. I hope you all enjoyed and found this post useful for a not-so-often programmed function of this production planning section of SAP.\n\nAnother note and quick plug :smile: I hope everyone can appreciate the time I put into creating these posts (_hint:_ posts this long take a **LONG** time to write!). It would make me happy and give me the motivation to keep writing these detailed ABAP posts if you'd consider donating (in the footer of any page on this blog) I have a [PayPal.me link](https://www.paypal.me/chrisfrewin), and I'm also an Ethereum developer if you'd like to donate Ether or if you would like to donate some RaiBlocks, as I am a RaiBlocks enthusiast if you would prefer to donate in that way.\n\n:poop: Ok, plug done! :poop:\n\nCheers! :beer:\n\n<hr/>\n\n# Footnotes\n\n<div id=\"footnote-1\">\n1. Activities/phases are for production orders; Operations are for process orders. From this point onward, I will refer just to activities, since this post focuses on production orders. I also post the adjacent code for process orders in this post.\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"footnote-2\">\n2. I have to give credit where credit is due! I received a lot of assistance from our production planning module supervisor - he showed me the transactions that finally got me to a working result. :thumbsup:\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"footnote-3\">\n3. You can set up your production planning (PP) module to give you a proposal amount for the activities, directly when you are doing confirmations transaction <span style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">CO11N</span>:\n\nUpon pressing 'enter' for with a new amount:\n![Automatic calculation of confirmation activities by the System in transaction CO11N](./co11n-1.jpg)\n\nPressing 'OK' for this window, we get a popup:\n\n![Filling confirmation activities by hand in transaction CO11N](./co11n-2.jpg)\n\nWe see that the Labor time is provided here. It's likely 30 min for a full 100 KG, since the system is proposing only 15 minutes for 50 KG, half of what the full order amount should be. (I know, it's not a full four field example - but values would also be proposed if you had more fields like machine time, machine set-up, etc.)\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"footnote-4\">\n4. Note: At my company, we usually use only up to four confirmation activities. Note that there can be up to six, but for this example, we'll say that the confirmation process has only a maximum of four.\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"footnote-5\">\n5. I ended up determining that you can exclude parameter `co_a` without any issues - however, this may be how the settings at my own company work - you can look deeper into the SAP example to include it.\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"footnote-6\">\n6. This issue does not affect the confirmation formulas, but rather the goods movements in the retrograde ingredients - specifically when the goods movements are to be overridden, for example with a batch split for a retrograde material, or a custom under- or over- amount of a retrograde material. For the rare case where an employee wanted to book some of our retrograde materials from various batch numbers and warehouse locations, they noticed in these custom goods movements with the confirmation were not being added; but rather always the default SAP-calculated amounts. After some head scratching, I found it all has to do with function module <span style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">BAPI_PRODORDCONF_CREATE_TT</span> (or <span style=\"font-family:'Courier New'\">BAPI_PROCORDCONF_CREATE_TT</span> depending on your use case) - I was not passing in an important parameter which allows exactly this desired override behavior:\n\n<pre>\nLinkConfGoodsmov\nThe assignment of the goods movements to a confirmation is effected\nvia the LinkConfGoodsmov table. There must be an entry in this table\nfor every entry in the Goodsmovements table. The index in the\nLinkConfGoodsmov-Index_Confirm field refers to the line of the\nassociated confirmation in the Timetickets table and the index in\nthe LinkConfGoodsmov-Index_Goodsmov field refers the associated\ngoods movement in the Goodsmovements table.\nIf you want to prevent a goods movement from being posted for a\nconfirmation according to the standard logic, make an entry in the\nLinkConfGoodsmov table as well as in the Timetickets table. The\nindex in the LinkConfGoodsmov-Index_Confirm field refers to the line\nof the associated confirmation in the Timetickets table. Enter the\ninitial value 0 in the LinkConfGoodsmov-Index_Goodsmov field. It is\nnot necessary to make an entry in the Goodsmovements table in this\ncase.\nIf there is no entry in the LinkConfGoodsmov table for a\nconfirmation, goods movements are determined for backflushing and\nautomatic goods receipt using the standard logic.\n</pre>\n\nWe needed to add the following too our goods movements loop (already added in the code above! :smile:):\n\n```abap\nBLAH\n```\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n",

Follow along through all the technical steps I took to generate the images if you're interested. If not, just head down to the bottom to see the results!\n\n# 1. Acquiring The Pixel Maps\n\n I found map sprites of all 20 towns from the amazing Spriter's Resource: [https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_gbc/pokemongoldsilver/](https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_gbc/pokemongoldsilver/)\n\n# 2. Breakdown of Maps into 16x16 Pixel Tiles\n\nAfter getting all 20 towns, the only requirement is that the map that can be actually be broken into 16x16 pieces - as you'll notice the sprite people often put all the insides of buildings onto the same .png file, so this just took careful cropping to get the part that interested me - the 'outside' part of the towns with the buildings, flora, and road/path tiles.\n\n(Yes, I know - with some effort this too could have been automated, but hey, it took me a total of about 15 minutes to crop the 20 towns myself, so in this case I think good old elbow grease was the faster method)\n\nI wrote a Python function `createTiles` that moves in 16x16 blocks across the maps, saving each block as it's own separate .png file:\n\n```python \nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy\nimport os\n\n# definitions\ndef createTiles(sTownName):\n    oImage = Image.open(sTownName + \"/\" + sTownName + \".png\") # big town png\n    oRGBAImage = oImage.convert('RGBA') # covert to RGBA values\n    iWidth = oImage.size[0]\n    iHeight = oImage.size[1]\n\n    data = numpy.asarray(oRGBAImage)\n    count = 0\n    for j in range(16,iHeight,16): # y down\n        for k in range(16,iWidth,16): # x across\n            row = data[j-16:j]\n            tile = []\n            for i in range(0,16):\n                tile.append(row[i][k-16:k])\n            oTile = numpy.asarray(tile)\n            im = Image.fromarray(oTile) # this array represents the current tile we are at \n            if not os.path.exists(sTownName):\n                os.makedirs(sTownName)\n            im.save(sTownName + \"/\" + str(count) + \".png\")\n            count = count + 1\n```\n\n# 3. Converting PNG Tiles to SVG\n\nBut hey,.pngs that are only 16x16 pixels in size are no fun - you can't scale that up to giant resolution wihtout inevitable blurring or such - to keep them crisp, I converted each 16x16 tile into an .svg using a previous tool that I built, [pixelmatic](https://github.com/frewinchristopher/pixelmatic).\n\nGreat, now we just need to print the tiles in a creative fashion!\n\n# 4. Printing Tiles in a Hexagonal Pattern\n\nI had this neat idea to create a spiral and print all the tiles, including repeats, from each town into an outward spiraling fashion. As you can see from my beloved notebook notes, I spent almost too long try how the heck to print the tiles out in such a pattern:\n\n![Trying to figure it out.]()\n\nTrying to figure it out.\n\n\n![Getting confused... STILL trying!]() \n\nGetting confused... STILL trying!\n \n\nAfter lots of brainstorming, I realized it was easiest to implement by creating a walking vector. Each ring has a known count of tiles, and then you just walk around the hexagon:\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom duplicates import buildDuplicatesList # refactored duplicate function\nfrom PIL import Image\n\niSquareRadius = 8 # square radius of 16x16 tiles is 8\n\n# given int, returns array representing x, y coordinates\ndef getStartingCoordinatesOfRing(iRingNumber, iSquareRadius):\n    return [2*iRingNumber*iSquareRadius, iRingNumber*iSquareRadius]\n\ndef printHex(sTownName):\n    # initialize vars\n    lDirectionVectors = [(0,-2*iSquareRadius),(-2*iSquareRadius,-1*iSquareRadius),(-2*iSquareRadius,1*iSquareRadius),(0,2*iSquareRadius),(2*iSquareRadius,1*iSquareRadius),(2*iSquareRadius,-1*iSquareRadius)] # down, SSW, NNW, up, NNE, SSE... and no, SSW is not southby -_-\n    iNumRings = 23\n    lRepeatImageNames = buildDuplicatesList(sTownName)\n    iImageWidth = 2*iNumRings*2*iSquareRadius\n    iImageHeight = 2*iNumRings*2*iSquareRadius\n    oImage = Image.new('RGBA', (iImageWidth, iImageHeight)) # initialize our image we will build # TODO: add padding?\n    \n    # initialize vars for loop - start pattern off with tile in the center (exact centered around 0 will be minus a radius in x and plus a radius in y)\n    iImageIndex = 0\n    iDirectionVectorsIndex = 0\n    sFileName = lRepeatImageNames[iImageIndex] # first tile image will be the tile that is repeated most - and will continue for the number of times\n    oTileImage = Image.open(sFileName)\n    lCurrentDirectionVector = lDirectionVectors[iDirectionVectorsIndex] # initial direction for each ring (down)\n    oImage.paste(oTileImage, (iImageWidth / 2 - iSquareRadius,iImageHeight / 2 - iSquareRadius)) # tile in center of image\n    iImageIndex = iImageIndex + 1 # increment image index\n    \n    for i in range(1,iNumRings): # loop through desired ring numbers\n        iNumTiles = i*6 # ring 1 has \n        iDirectionRepeatAmount = i # the number of times to repeat a direction before changing it also happens to be the ring number\n        lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates = getStartingCoordinatesOfRing(i, iSquareRadius) # starting coordinate of this ring\n        iSameDirectionTimes = 0 # initialize times\n        iDirectionVectorsIndex = 0 # initialize direction index\n        lCurrentDirectionVector = lDirectionVectors[ iDirectionVectorsIndex % len(lDirectionVectors) ]\n        print \"RING \" + str(i) + \"------------------------------\"\n        for j in range(0,iNumTiles): # print tiles for this ring\n            if iSameDirectionTimes == iDirectionRepeatAmount: # first determine direction for this\n                iSameDirectionTimes = 0 # reset direction count\n                iDirectionVectorsIndex = iDirectionVectorsIndex + 1 # increment to new direction ( we walk around the rings clockwise as we 'paint' )\n                lCurrentDirectionVector = lDirectionVectors[ iDirectionVectorsIndex % len(lDirectionVectors) ] # modulo gives us the proper index such that lDirectionVectors acts as a cirular list\n            if iImageIndex == len(lRepeatImageNames): # we've exhausted all our tiles\n                print \"No more tiles :( headin on out...\"\n                oImage.save(\"results/\" + sTownName + '.png') # save the finished image in the folder with its tiles\n                return # done processing\n            sFileName = lRepeatImageNames[iImageIndex] # first tile image will be the tile that is repeated most - and will continue for the number of times\n            oTileImage = Image.open(sFileName) # open the image that corresponds to the duplicate data\n            print \"Current tile coord: (\" + str(lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates[0]) + \", \"+ str(lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates[1]) + \")\"\n            oImage.paste(oTileImage, (iImageWidth / 2 - iSquareRadius + lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates[0],iImageHeight / 2 - iSquareRadius + lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates[1])) # paste this tile at these coordinates into the image!\n            print \"Now moving \" + str(lCurrentDirectionVector[0]) + \" in X\"\n            print \"and \" + str(lCurrentDirectionVector[1]) + \" in Y\"\n            lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates[0] = lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates[0] + lCurrentDirectionVector[0] # x direction to go from vector\n            lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates[1] = lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates[1] + lCurrentDirectionVector[1] # y direction to go from vector\n            iImageIndex = iImageIndex + 1 # increment image index\n            iSameDirectionTimes = iSameDirectionTimes + 1 # also increase direction 'times'\n```\n\n# 5. Data Analysis\n\nOk, I'll admit it, the goal of this project was much more heavily leaning towards the art & design component: for 'data analysis' I didn't really do much of anything except find the duplicates of each tile in each town - and how many times that tile appeared, because I needed exactly that info to generate the town designs.\n\nBuilding off the code that is in [the repository](), some other interesting info would be to find:\n\n- total number of unique tiles across the entire game - finding most unique and most repeated tile\n- total number of colors\n\nThough perhaps hunting around on the web this info is already freely avaliable.\n\nTo get the counts of each repeats, after all 16x16 tiles were generated, I got the idea to just find a python script which counts duplicate files by content (a hash comparing algorithm). I found a nice one by Andres Torres at Python Central: [https://www.pythoncentral.io/finding-duplicate-files-with-python/](https://www.pythoncentral.io/finding-duplicate-files-with-python/). I refactored it so it could just be called as a function and return an array of each repeat file name. \n\nWhat I mean by this is: let's say '1.svg' was the 'ground' tile, and it was found to have the same contents as 336 other tiles in Goldenrod City. Well, this array would include the string '1.png' as the first 336 elements, then a string with the next most repeated file name, and so on. The array that this function returns is the key looping array as we print our hexagonal style pattern in `printer.py`.\n\nHere's an example of identical tiles and how often they repeat for Goldenrod:\n```\n336 like goldenrod/348.png (ground)\n230 like goldenrod/374.png (pink tiles)\n62 like goldenrod/1409.png (tree top)\n56 like goldenrod/823.png (water)\n56 like goldenrod/1226.png (right corner house)\n56 like goldenrod/201.png (left corner house)\n53 like goldenrod/1353.png (fence)\n51 like goldenrod/943.png (roof top right corner)\n51 like goldenrod/162.png (roof top left corner)\n48 like goldenrod/229.png (house normal wall)\n46 like goldenrod/1186.png (roof center)\n31 like goldenrod/1481.png (tree bottom)\n26 like goldenrod/400.png (roof top edge)\n26 like goldenrod/439.png (roof bottom edge)\n25 like goldenrod/539.png (top edge ground)\n25 like goldenrod/77.png (rock wall middle)\n20 like goldenrod/1368.png (shore)\n18 like goldenrod/1030.png (gold brick wall)\n17 like goldenrod/505.png (brown dirt top edge)\n15 like goldenrod/1387.png (ground with gray fence)\n14 like goldenrod/159.png (etc... you've gotta be kidding if you think I will)\n14 like goldenrod/158.png\n14 like goldenrod/980.png\n14 like goldenrod/198.png\n14 like goldenrod/429.png\n10 like goldenrod/1421.png\n10 like goldenrod/610.png\n9 like goldenrod/758.png\n9 like goldenrod/238.png\n9 like goldenrod/200.png\n9 like goldenrod/403.png\n9 like goldenrod/170.png\n9 like goldenrod/217.png\n9 like goldenrod/377.png\n8 like goldenrod/920.png\n8 like goldenrod/148.png\n6 like goldenrod/107.png\n6 like goldenrod/149.png\n6 like goldenrod/512.png\n5 like goldenrod/260.png\n5 like goldenrod/261.png\n5 like goldenrod/831.png\n5 like goldenrod/836.png\n4 like goldenrod/880.png\n4 like goldenrod/249.png\n4 like goldenrod/1031.png\n4 like goldenrod/784.png\n3 like goldenrod/570.png\n3 like goldenrod/573.png\n3 like goldenrod/548.png\n3 like goldenrod/572.png\n3 like goldenrod/248.png\n3 like goldenrod/571.png\n2 like goldenrod/389.png\n2 like goldenrod/1343.png\n2 like goldenrod/658.png\n2 like goldenrod/1171.png\n2 like goldenrod/659.png\n2 like goldenrod/997.png\n2 like goldenrod/161.png\n2 like goldenrod/924.png\n2 like goldenrod/1173.png\nTotal Duplicates: 1507\n```\n\nSo our return array would contain 1507 string elements, each with the value of that repeated file's name.\n\n# 6. Final Results\n\nI repeated this process for all the towns of Kanto and Johto (for non-Pokemon nerds: the 'original' towns and cities of Pokemon, plus the '2nd generation' towns, a total of 20):\n\n```\nAzalea Town\t   Johto\nBlackthorn City\t   Johto\nCeladon City\t Kanto\nCerulean City Kanto\nCherrygrove City   Johto\nCinnabar Island\t Kanto\nCianwood City   Johto\nEcruteak City\t   Johto\nFuchsia City Kanto\nGoldenrod City   Johto\nLavender Town\t Kanto\nMahogany Town\t   Johto\nNew Bark Town\t   Johto\nOlivine City   Johto\nPallet Town Kanto\nPewter City\t Kanto\nSaffron City\t Kanto\nVermilion City Kanto\nViolet City   Johto\nViridian City Kanto\n```\n\nThe repository has all the code, 16x16 pngs, svgs, and the final hex images in the `results` folder. [Check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/frewinchristopher/pokemon-town-pixel-art).\n\nI may revisit this project for more designs at some point, I think there are a lot of cool things that could be done with these tiles.\n\nI call it *The Pokemon Kaleidoscope Series*!!!\n\nEnjoy!\n\n# The Pokemon Kaleidoscope Series\n\nAzalea Town\t (Johto):\n![Azalea Town\t (Johto)](azalea.png)\nBlackthorn City\t (Johto):\n![Blackthorn City\t (Johto)](blackthorn.png)\nCeladon City\t (Kanto):\n![Celadon City\t (Kanto)](celadon.png)\nCerulean City (Kanto):\n![Cerulean City (Kanto)](cerulean.png)\nCherrygrove City (Johto):\n![Cherrygrove City (Johto)](cherrygrove.png)\nCinnabar Island\t (Kanto):\n![Cinnabar Island\t (Kanto)](cinnabar.png)\nCianwood City (Johto):\n![Cianwood City (Johto)](cianwood.png)\nEcruteak City\t (Johto):\n![Ecruteak City\t (Johto)](ecruteak.png)\nFuchsia City (Kanto):\n![Fuchsia City (Kanto)](fuchsia.png)\nGoldenrod City (Johto):\n![Goldenrod City (Johto)](goldenrod.png)\nLavender Town\t (Kanto):\n![Lavender Town\t (Kanto)](lavender.png)\nMahogany Town\t (Johto):\n![Mahogany Town\t (Johto)](mahogany.png)\nNew Bark Town (Johto):\n![New Bark Town\t (Johto)](newbark.png)\nOlivine City (Johto):\n![Olivine City (Johto)](olivine.png)\nPallet Town (Kanto):\n![Pallet Town (Kanto)](pallet.png)\nPewter City\t (Kanto):\n![Pewter City\t (Kanto)](pewter.png)\nSaffron City\t (Kanto):\n![Saffron City\t (Kanto)](saffron.png)\nVermilion City (Kanto):\n![Vermilion City (Kanto)](vermilion.png)\nViolet City (Johto):\n![Violet City (Johto)](violet.png)\nViridian City (Kanto):\n![Viridian City (Kanto)](viridian.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Breakdown of Maps into 16x16 Pixel Tiles\n\nAfter getting all 20 towns, the only requirement is that the map that can be actually be broken into 16x16 pieces - as you'll notice the sprite people often put all the insides of buildings onto the same .png file, so this just took careful cropping to get the part that interested me - the 'outside' part of the towns with the buildings, flora, and road/path tiles.\n\n(Yes, I know - with some effort this too could have been automated, but hey, it took me a total of about 15 minutes to crop the 20 towns myself, so in this case I think good old elbow grease was the faster method)\n\nI wrote a Python function `createTiles` that moves in 16x16 blocks across the maps, saving each block as it's own separate .png file:\n\n```python \nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy\nimport os\n\n# definitions\ndef createTiles(sTownName):\n    oImage = Image.open(sTownName + \"/\" + sTownName + \".png\") # big town png\n    oRGBAImage = oImage.convert('RGBA') # covert to RGBA values\n    iWidth = oImage.size[0]\n    iHeight = oImage.size[1]\n\n    data = numpy.asarray(oRGBAImage)\n    count = 0\n    for j in range(16,iHeight,16): # y down\n        for k in range(16,iWidth,16): # x across\n            row = data[j-16:j]\n            tile = []\n            for i in range(0,16):\n                tile.append(row[i][k-16:k])\n            oTile = numpy.asarray(tile)\n            im = Image.fromarray(oTile) # this array represents the current tile we are at \n            if not os.path.exists(sTownName):\n                os.makedirs(sTownName)\n            im.save(sTownName + \"/\" + str(count) + \".png\")\n            count = count + 1\n```\n\n# 3. Converting PNG Tiles to SVG\n\nBut hey,.pngs that are only 16x16 pixels in size are no fun - you can't scale that up to giant resolution wihtout inevitable blurring or such - to keep them crisp, I converted each 16x16 tile into an .svg using a previous tool that I built, [pixelmatic](https://github.com/frewinchristopher/pixelmatic).\n\nGreat, now we just need to print the tiles in a creative fashion!\n\n# 4. Printing Tiles in a Hexagonal Pattern\n\nI had this neat idea to create a spiral and print all the tiles, including repeats, from each town into an outward spiraling fashion. As you can see from my beloved notebook notes, I spent almost too long try how the heck to print the tiles out in such a pattern:\n\n![Trying to figure it out.]()\n\nTrying to figure it out.\n\n\n![Getting confused... STILL trying!]() \n\nGetting confused... STILL trying!\n \n\nAfter lots of brainstorming, I realized it was easiest to implement by creating a walking vector. Each ring has a known count of tiles, and then you just walk around the hexagon:\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom duplicates import buildDuplicatesList # refactored duplicate function\nfrom PIL import Image\n\niSquareRadius = 8 # square radius of 16x16 tiles is 8\n\n# given int, returns array representing x, y coordinates\ndef getStartingCoordinatesOfRing(iRingNumber, iSquareRadius):\n    return [2*iRingNumber*iSquareRadius, iRingNumber*iSquareRadius]\n\ndef printHex(sTownName):\n    # initialize vars\n    lDirectionVectors = [(0,-2*iSquareRadius),(-2*iSquareRadius,-1*iSquareRadius),(-2*iSquareRadius,1*iSquareRadius),(0,2*iSquareRadius),(2*iSquareRadius,1*iSquareRadius),(2*iSquareRadius,-1*iSquareRadius)] # down, SSW, NNW, up, NNE, SSE... and no, SSW is not southby -_-\n    iNumRings = 23\n    lRepeatImageNames = buildDuplicatesList(sTownName)\n    iImageWidth = 2*iNumRings*2*iSquareRadius\n    iImageHeight = 2*iNumRings*2*iSquareRadius\n    oImage = Image.new('RGBA', (iImageWidth, iImageHeight)) # initialize our image we will build # TODO: add padding?\n    \n    # initialize vars for loop - start pattern off with tile in the center (exact centered around 0 will be minus a radius in x and plus a radius in y)\n    iImageIndex = 0\n    iDirectionVectorsIndex = 0\n    sFileName = lRepeatImageNames[iImageIndex] # first tile image will be the tile that is repeated most - and will continue for the number of times\n    oTileImage = Image.open(sFileName)\n    lCurrentDirectionVector = lDirectionVectors[iDirectionVectorsIndex] # initial direction for each ring (down)\n    oImage.paste(oTileImage, (iImageWidth / 2 - iSquareRadius,iImageHeight / 2 - iSquareRadius)) # tile in center of image\n    iImageIndex = iImageIndex + 1 # increment image index\n    \n    for i in range(1,iNumRings): # loop through desired ring numbers\n        iNumTiles = i*6 # ring 1 has \n        iDirectionRepeatAmount = i # the number of times to repeat a direction before changing it also happens to be the ring number\n        lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates = getStartingCoordinatesOfRing(i, iSquareRadius) # starting coordinate of this ring\n        iSameDirectionTimes = 0 # initialize times\n        iDirectionVectorsIndex = 0 # initialize direction index\n        lCurrentDirectionVector = lDirectionVectors[ iDirectionVectorsIndex % len(lDirectionVectors) ]\n        print \"RING \" + str(i) + \"------------------------------\"\n        for j in range(0,iNumTiles): # print tiles for this ring\n            if iSameDirectionTimes == iDirectionRepeatAmount: # first determine direction for this\n                iSameDirectionTimes = 0 # reset direction count\n                iDirectionVectorsIndex = iDirectionVectorsIndex + 1 # increment to new direction ( we walk around the rings clockwise as we 'paint' )\n                lCurrentDirectionVector = lDirectionVectors[ iDirectionVectorsIndex % len(lDirectionVectors) ] # modulo gives us the proper index such that lDirectionVectors acts as a cirular list\n            if iImageIndex == len(lRepeatImageNames): # we've exhausted all our tiles\n                print \"No more tiles :( headin on out...\"\n                oImage.save(\"results/\" + sTownName + '.png') # save the finished image in the folder with its tiles\n                return # done processing\n            sFileName = lRepeatImageNames[iImageIndex] # first tile image will be the tile that is repeated most - and will continue for the number of times\n            oTileImage = Image.open(sFileName) # open the image that corresponds to the duplicate data\n            print \"Current tile coord: (\" + str(lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates[0]) + \", \"+ str(lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates[1]) + \")\"\n            oImage.paste(oTileImage, (iImageWidth / 2 - iSquareRadius + lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates[0],iImageHeight / 2 - iSquareRadius + lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates[1])) # paste this tile at these coordinates into the image!\n            print \"Now moving \" + str(lCurrentDirectionVector[0]) + \" in X\"\n            print \"and \" + str(lCurrentDirectionVector[1]) + \" in Y\"\n            lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates[0] = lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates[0] + lCurrentDirectionVector[0] # x direction to go from vector\n            lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates[1] = lCurrentTileCenterCoordinates[1] + lCurrentDirectionVector[1] # y direction to go from vector\n            iImageIndex = iImageIndex + 1 # increment image index\n            iSameDirectionTimes = iSameDirectionTimes + 1 # also increase direction 'times'\n```\n\n# 5. Data Analysis\n\nOk, I'll admit it, the goal of this project was much more heavily leaning towards the art & design component: for 'data analysis' I didn't really do much of anything except find the duplicates of each tile in each town - and how many times that tile appeared, because I needed exactly that info to generate the town designs.\n\nBuilding off the code that is in [the repository](), some other interesting info would be to find:\n\n- total number of unique tiles across the entire game - finding most unique and most repeated tile\n- total number of colors\n\nThough perhaps hunting around on the web this info is already freely avaliable.\n\nTo get the counts of each repeats, after all 16x16 tiles were generated, I got the idea to just find a python script which counts duplicate files by content (a hash comparing algorithm). I found a nice one by Andres Torres at Python Central: [https://www.pythoncentral.io/finding-duplicate-files-with-python/](https://www.pythoncentral.io/finding-duplicate-files-with-python/). I refactored it so it could just be called as a function and return an array of each repeat file name. \n\nWhat I mean by this is: let's say '1.svg' was the 'ground' tile, and it was found to have the same contents as 336 other tiles in Goldenrod City. Well, this array would include the string '1.png' as the first 336 elements, then a string with the next most repeated file name, and so on. The array that this function returns is the key looping array as we print our hexagonal style pattern in `printer.py`.\n\nHere's an example of identical tiles and how often they repeat for Goldenrod:\n```\n336 like goldenrod/348.png (ground)\n230 like goldenrod/374.png (pink tiles)\n62 like goldenrod/1409.png (tree top)\n56 like goldenrod/823.png (water)\n56 like goldenrod/1226.png (right corner house)\n56 like goldenrod/201.png (left corner house)\n53 like goldenrod/1353.png (fence)\n51 like goldenrod/943.png (roof top right corner)\n51 like goldenrod/162.png (roof top left corner)\n48 like goldenrod/229.png (house normal wall)\n46 like goldenrod/1186.png (roof center)\n31 like goldenrod/1481.png (tree bottom)\n26 like goldenrod/400.png (roof top edge)\n26 like goldenrod/439.png (roof bottom edge)\n25 like goldenrod/539.png (top edge ground)\n25 like goldenrod/77.png (rock wall middle)\n20 like goldenrod/1368.png (shore)\n18 like goldenrod/1030.png (gold brick wall)\n17 like goldenrod/505.png (brown dirt top edge)\n15 like goldenrod/1387.png (ground with gray fence)\n14 like goldenrod/159.png (etc... you've gotta be kidding if you think I will)\n14 like goldenrod/158.png\n14 like goldenrod/980.png\n14 like goldenrod/198.png\n14 like goldenrod/429.png\n10 like goldenrod/1421.png\n10 like goldenrod/610.png\n9 like goldenrod/758.png\n9 like goldenrod/238.png\n9 like goldenrod/200.png\n9 like goldenrod/403.png\n9 like goldenrod/170.png\n9 like goldenrod/217.png\n9 like goldenrod/377.png\n8 like goldenrod/920.png\n8 like goldenrod/148.png\n6 like goldenrod/107.png\n6 like goldenrod/149.png\n6 like goldenrod/512.png\n5 like goldenrod/260.png\n5 like goldenrod/261.png\n5 like goldenrod/831.png\n5 like goldenrod/836.png\n4 like goldenrod/880.png\n4 like goldenrod/249.png\n4 like goldenrod/1031.png\n4 like goldenrod/784.png\n3 like goldenrod/570.png\n3 like goldenrod/573.png\n3 like goldenrod/548.png\n3 like goldenrod/572.png\n3 like goldenrod/248.png\n3 like goldenrod/571.png\n2 like goldenrod/389.png\n2 like goldenrod/1343.png\n2 like goldenrod/658.png\n2 like goldenrod/1171.png\n2 like goldenrod/659.png\n2 like goldenrod/997.png\n2 like goldenrod/161.png\n2 like goldenrod/924.png\n2 like goldenrod/1173.png\nTotal Duplicates: 1507\n```\n\nSo our return array would contain 1507 string elements, each with the value of that repeated file's name.\n\n# 6. Final Results\n\nI repeated this process for all the towns of Kanto and Johto (for non-Pokemon nerds: the 'original' towns and cities of Pokemon, plus the '2nd generation' towns, a total of 20):\n\n```\nAzalea Town\t   Johto\nBlackthorn City\t   Johto\nCeladon City\t Kanto\nCerulean City Kanto\nCherrygrove City   Johto\nCinnabar Island\t Kanto\nCianwood City   Johto\nEcruteak City\t   Johto\nFuchsia City Kanto\nGoldenrod City   Johto\nLavender Town\t Kanto\nMahogany Town\t   Johto\nNew Bark Town\t   Johto\nOlivine City   Johto\nPallet Town Kanto\nPewter City\t Kanto\nSaffron City\t Kanto\nVermilion City Kanto\nViolet City   Johto\nViridian City Kanto\n```\n\nThe repository has all the code, 16x16 pngs, svgs, and the final hex images in the `results` folder. [Check it out on GitHub](https://github.com/frewinchristopher/pokemon-town-pixel-art).\n\nI may revisit this project for more designs at some point, I think there are a lot of cool things that could be done with these tiles.\n\nI call it *The Pokemon Kaleidoscope Series*!!!\n\nEnjoy!\n\n# The Pokemon Kaleidoscope Series\n\nAzalea Town\t (Johto):\n![Azalea Town\t (Johto)](azalea.png)\nBlackthorn City\t (Johto):\n![Blackthorn City\t (Johto)](blackthorn.png)\nCeladon City\t (Kanto):\n![Celadon City\t (Kanto)](celadon.png)\nCerulean City (Kanto):\n![Cerulean City (Kanto)](cerulean.png)\nCherrygrove City (Johto):\n![Cherrygrove City (Johto)](cherrygrove.png)\nCinnabar Island\t (Kanto):\n![Cinnabar Island\t (Kanto)](cinnabar.png)\nCianwood City (Johto):\n![Cianwood City (Johto)](cianwood.png)\nEcruteak City\t (Johto):\n![Ecruteak City\t (Johto)](ecruteak.png)\nFuchsia City (Kanto):\n![Fuchsia City (Kanto)](fuchsia.png)\nGoldenrod City (Johto):\n![Goldenrod City (Johto)](goldenrod.png)\nLavender Town\t (Kanto):\n![Lavender Town\t (Kanto)](lavender.png)\nMahogany Town\t (Johto):\n![Mahogany Town\t (Johto)](mahogany.png)\nNew Bark Town (Johto):\n![New Bark Town\t (Johto)](newbark.png)\nOlivine City (Johto):\n![Olivine City (Johto)](olivine.png)\nPallet Town (Kanto):\n![Pallet Town (Kanto)](pallet.png)\nPewter City\t (Kanto):\n![Pewter City\t (Kanto)](pewter.png)\nSaffron City\t (Kanto):\n![Saffron City\t (Kanto)](saffron.png)\nVermilion City (Kanto):\n![Vermilion City (Kanto)](vermilion.png)\nViolet City (Johto):\n![Violet City (Johto)](violet.png)\nViridian City (Kanto):\n![Viridian City (Kanto)](viridian.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

(Go on, you can try clicking on it). However, if you're not an authorized party (which I check via a _secret key_) you'll just be redirected to the plain ol' [https://chrisfrew.in](https://chrisfrew.in) - yeah I know, what a crappy blog.\n\nIf any of this stuff sounds cool, or perhaps more importantly, sounds like a foreign language, then c'mon in and dive in - we'll get into the technical details and all steps of how all of this can be set up.\n\nRemember, all this stuff is open source too. The repository for the monitor is here: https://github.com/frewinchristopher/chrisfrew.in-productions-github-bitbucket-monitor\n\n(The full code is also posted at the bottom of this post.)\n\n## Setting Up a Catch-All webhooks subdomain\n\nSo [chrisfrew.in](chrisfrew.in) is registered on Namecheap. We have to just setup two A Records, both for webhooks www.webhooks. It looks like this:\n\n![Namecheap configuration](namecheap_config.png)\n\n## Listing on Webhooks subdomain - POST and 'all'\n\nSo first off, we want our express app to only do special things on a post to the root (in this case, because I run NGINX, we are already in the webhooks.chrisfrew.in namespace here) - otherwise we redirect to https://chrisfrew.in\n\nNotice that even when ARE POSTed to, we still verify the signature of the request, otherwise just like the `all('*')`, we redirect (301) the traffic to chrisfrew.in.\n\n```javascript\napp.post('/', (req, res) => {\n  if (verifySignature(req)) {\n    determineWebhook(req.body);\n    // authentic source\n    console.log('Authentication successful; processing data:');\n    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });\n  } else {\n    // Someone else calling\n    console.log('Authentication failed; redirecting them to https://chrisfrew.in');\n    res.redirect(301, 'https://chrisfrew.in/'); // Redirect to domain root\n  }\n});\n\napp.all('*', (req, res) => {\n  // Someone else calling\n  console.log('Authentication failed; redirecting them to https://chrisfrew.in');\n  res.redirect(301, 'https://chrisfrew.in/'); // Redirect to domain root\n}); // Only webhook requests allowed at this address\n```\n\n## Determine What type of Webhook\n\nRight now I only process GitHub and Bitbucket Webhooks. It's rudimentary, and it's not even finished, but it works for GitHub:\n\n```javascript\nconst determineWebhook = (oData) => {\n  let sStatus;\n  if (oData.sender) { // GitHub\n    sStatus = \"New head commit in \" + oData.repository.name + \" (\" + oData.repository.url + \"): \" + oData.head_commit.committer.name;\n    if (oData.head_commit.added)  {\n      sStatus = sStatus + \" added \" + oData.head_commit.added.length + \" files, \";\n    }\n    if (oData.head_commit.modified)  {\n      sStatus = sStatus +  \" modified \" + oData.head_commit.modified.length + \" files, and\";\n    }\n    if (oData.head_commit.removed) {\n      sStatus = sStatus +  \" removed \" + oData.head_commit.removed.length + \" files.\";\n    }\n   console.log(sStatus);\n   messageHub(\"Attempting to pull from this repository...\");\n   pull(oRepositoryPathValuePairs[oData.repository.name]);\n    //twitterBotUtils.postStatus(sStatus);\n  } else if (oData.actor) { // Bitbucket\n    \n    //twitterBotUtils.postStatus(sStatus);\n  } else { // some other webhook (there are no others yet)\n    \n  }\n};\n```\n\n## GitHub Integration\n\nWith our subdomain set up and our express server serving there, we can start processing requests for `webhooks.chrisfrew.in`. The important thing here is to validate requests. Imagine what could happen without validation, (if I eventualy do hook this up to my twitter bot to post every time a repository is updated) just anyone could send random github-ish looking json data to `webhooks.chrisfrew.in`, and my server would take action, even when its not coming from a validate That would be really annoying, and plus, it would make me seem _way_ more productive than I am with my repositories. 😂😂😂 So yeah, validation is an important step. \n\nGitHub's way of doing authentication for webhooks is to take the content of the payload, concatenate that with the secret key, and then hash it. You then do the same on your server, since you yourself also know the secret key, and if the hashes match, violá! You know it's coming from GitHub. We accomplish this in Nodejs in a function called `verifySignature` like so:\n\n```javascript\n// Verification function to check if it is actually GitHub who is POSTing here\nconst verifySignature = (req) => {\n  if (!req.headers['user-agent'].includes('GitHub-Hookshot')) {\n    return false;\n  }\n  // Compare their hmac signature to our hmac signature\n  // (hmac = hash-based message authentication code)\n  const sExternalSignature = req.headers['x-hub-signature'];\n  const oData = JSON.stringify(req.body);\n  const sSecret = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET; \n  const sInternalSignature = `sha1=${crypto.createHmac('sha1', sSecret).update(oData).digest('hex')}`;\n  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(sExternalSignature), Buffer.from(sInternalSignature));\n};\n```\n\n## GitHub Integration\n\nSo, we know - then on the production server we want to naturally pull this newest code from the remote? For that, there is the NPM package `simple-git` [https://github.com/steveukx/git-js#readme](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js#readme).\n\n```javascript\nconst pull = (sRootRepositoryDirectory) => {\n  git.cwd(sRootRepositoryDirectory).pull((err, update) => {\n     if(update && update.summary.changes) { // there is indeed an update found on the remote\n        messageHub(\"This is an app templated by create-react-app; We need to issue 'npm run build' to build new source...\");\n        build();\n     } else if (err) {\n       if (err.includes(\"commit your changes or stash them\")) {\n         messageHub(\"Changes need to be stashed; stashing automatically...\");\n         stashAndPull(sRootRepositoryDirectory);\n       }// TODO: more error cases? ...\n     }\n  });\n}\nconst stashAndPull = (sRootRepositoryDirectory) => {\n  git.cwd(sRootRepositoryDirectory).stash()\n    .then(() => {\n      messageHub(\"Stash succesfull, attempting to pull again...\");\n      pull(sRootRepositoryDirectory);\n    });\n}\n```\n\n## Build Integration\n\nSo, I thought it was nice that we could detect pushes to the repository and then . But, with my create-react-apps, could I also build the source. If you were eagle-eyed, you may have seen that sneaky `build()` function. That function looks like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst build = () => {\n  exec('npm run build', { cwd: '../charge-keyboard.com' }, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n     if (err) {\n       messageHub(err);\n     } else if (stderr) {\n       messageHub(stderr);\n     } else {\n       messageHub(\"Build command successfully sent. The site should be live with the newly commited changes incorporated.\");\n     }\n   });\n}\n```\n\nThe _very_ cool thing here, at least I think, is that since I run my `index.js` servers with `forever`, when the source is built, whatever `index.js` is serving is updated, without affecting the runtime of `index.js` itself! So, I am nearly approaching a fully integrated build system that was all custom built. 😄\n\n## Other Fun stuff\n\nYou know how when your `npm start` wont work, only because of a missing module? I've always been like, well, the _single_ solution here _is to just install the friggen module_ Well, thanks to stdout, we can try to read those missing modules, install it, and try `npm start` again. This is something I am working on.\n\nYou'll notice a lot of the code is parsing `stdout` as strings - I realize out to an infinite time scale, this isn't a most robust way of checking error messages, so I'm working towards parsing the actual errors codes from Nodejs and reacting from those, instead of the error text itself.\n\nYou may have also noticed the function messageHub for nearly every logging type message. Indeed, we do log to the console, but I built this hub-type function so we could add more ways of messaging, one of them is through a Slack bot, which I show how to do in [Part 4](https://chrisfrew.in/fully-automating-chrisfrew-in-productions-part-4-of-building-a-slack-bot/)\n\nYou'll see I have logging util and twitter util functions commented out - they are coming - all with good time!\n\n## To Do List\n\nI've still got to add all my other sites to the monitor - this is just a matter adding to that key:value that the server monitors - see `oRepositoryPathValuePairs` in the code below for what I am talking about.\n\nWhat will be really cool is for the GitHub monitor to update itself when it sees that it's remote - yes, this is like some Terminator-level crap. This will be a special case, because in order for a flawless execution of the monitor server itself, it would have to spawn a child process of itself, then update its code, then start itself, finally killing the child process of its older version.\n\n## Full code\n\n`index.js`\n```javascript\n'use strict'; // strict\n\n// external library requires\nconst express = require('express');\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\nconst crypto = require('crypto');\nconst app = express();\nconst twitterBotUtils = require('../chrisfrew.in-productions-shared-functions/utils/twitterBotUtils.js');\nconst simpleGit = require('simple-git');\nconst git = simpleGit();\nconst axios = require('axios');\nconst exec = require('child_process').exec;\n\n// fixed port on dell\nconst iPort = 8087;\nconst oRepositoryPathValuePairs = {\n  \"charge-keyboard-splash-page\": \"../charge-keyboard.com\",\n  \"chrisfrew.in-productions-github-bitbucket-monitor\": \"\", // super meta - will restart itself\n}\n\n// The GitHub webhook MUST be configured to be sent as \"application/json\"\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n\n// Verification function to check if it is actually GitHub who is POSTing here\nconst verifySignature = (req) => {\n  if (!req.headers['user-agent'].includes('GitHub-Hookshot')) {\n    return false;\n  }\n  // Compare their hmac signature to our hmac signature\n  // (hmac = hash-based message authentication code)\n  const sExternalSignature = req.headers['x-hub-signature'];\n  const oData = JSON.stringify(req.body);\n  const sSecret = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET; \n  const sInternalSignature = `sha1=${crypto.createHmac('sha1', sSecret).update(oData).digest('hex')}`;\n  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(sExternalSignature), Buffer.from(sInternalSignature));\n};\n\nconst determineWebhook = (oData) => {\n  let sStatus;\n  if (oData.sender) { // GitHub\n    sStatus = \"New head commit in \" + oData.repository.name + \" (\" + oData.repository.url + \"): \" + oData.head_commit.committer.name;\n    if (oData.head_commit.added)  {\n      sStatus = sStatus + \" added \" + oData.head_commit.added.length + \" files, \";\n    }\n    if (oData.head_commit.modified)  {\n      sStatus = sStatus +  \" modified \" + oData.head_commit.modified.length + \" files, and\";\n    }\n    if (oData.head_commit.removed) {\n      sStatus = sStatus +  \" removed \" + oData.head_commit.removed.length + \" files.\";\n    }\n   console.log(sStatus);\n   messageHub(\"Attempting to pull from this repository...\");\n   pull(oRepositoryPathValuePairs[oData.repository.name]);\n    //twitterBotUtils.postStatus(sStatus);\n  } else if (oData.actor) { // Bitbucket\n    \n    //twitterBotUtils.postStatus(sStatus);\n  } else { // some other webhook (there are no others yet)\n    \n  }\n\n};\nconst pull = (sRootRepositoryDirectory) => {\n  git.cwd(sRootRepositoryDirectory).pull((err, update) => {\n     if(update && update.summary.changes) { // there is indeed an update found on the remote\n        messageHub(\"This is an app templated by create-react-app; We need to issue 'npm run build' to build new source...\");\n        build();\n     } else if (err) {\n       if (err.includes(\"commit your changes or stash them\")) {\n         messageHub(\"Changes need to be stashed; stashing automatically...\");\n         stashAndPull(sRootRepositoryDirectory);\n       }// TODO: more error cases? ...\n     }\n  });\n}\nconst stashAndPull = (sRootRepositoryDirectory) => {\n  git.cwd(sRootRepositoryDirectory).stash()\n    .then(() => {\n      messageHub(\"Stash succesfull, attempting to pull again...\");\n      pull(sRootRepositoryDirectory);\n    });\n}\nconst build = () => {\n  exec('npm run build', { cwd: '../charge-keyboard.com' }, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n     if (err) {\n       messageHub(err);\n     } else if (stderr) {\n       messageHub(stderr);\n     } else {\n       messageHub(\"Build command successfully sent.

We accomplish this in Nodejs in a function called `verifySignature` like so:\n\n```javascript\n// Verification function to check if it is actually GitHub who is POSTing here\nconst verifySignature = (req) => {\n  if (!req.headers['user-agent'].includes('GitHub-Hookshot')) {\n    return false;\n  }\n  // Compare their hmac signature to our hmac signature\n  // (hmac = hash-based message authentication code)\n  const sExternalSignature = req.headers['x-hub-signature'];\n  const oData = JSON.stringify(req.body);\n  const sSecret = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET; \n  const sInternalSignature = `sha1=${crypto.createHmac('sha1', sSecret).update(oData).digest('hex')}`;\n  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(sExternalSignature), Buffer.from(sInternalSignature));\n};\n```\n\n## GitHub Integration\n\nSo, we know - then on the production server we want to naturally pull this newest code from the remote? For that, there is the NPM package `simple-git` [https://github.com/steveukx/git-js#readme](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js#readme).\n\n```javascript\nconst pull = (sRootRepositoryDirectory) => {\n  git.cwd(sRootRepositoryDirectory).pull((err, update) => {\n     if(update && update.summary.changes) { // there is indeed an update found on the remote\n        messageHub(\"This is an app templated by create-react-app; We need to issue 'npm run build' to build new source...\");\n        build();\n     } else if (err) {\n       if (err.includes(\"commit your changes or stash them\")) {\n         messageHub(\"Changes need to be stashed; stashing automatically...\");\n         stashAndPull(sRootRepositoryDirectory);\n       }// TODO: more error cases? ...\n     }\n  });\n}\nconst stashAndPull = (sRootRepositoryDirectory) => {\n  git.cwd(sRootRepositoryDirectory).stash()\n    .then(() => {\n      messageHub(\"Stash succesfull, attempting to pull again...\");\n      pull(sRootRepositoryDirectory);\n    });\n}\n```\n\n## Build Integration\n\nSo, I thought it was nice that we could detect pushes to the repository and then . But, with my create-react-apps, could I also build the source. If you were eagle-eyed, you may have seen that sneaky `build()` function. That function looks like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst build = () => {\n  exec('npm run build', { cwd: '../charge-keyboard.com' }, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n     if (err) {\n       messageHub(err);\n     } else if (stderr) {\n       messageHub(stderr);\n     } else {\n       messageHub(\"Build command successfully sent. The site should be live with the newly commited changes incorporated.\");\n     }\n   });\n}\n```\n\nThe _very_ cool thing here, at least I think, is that since I run my `index.js` servers with `forever`, when the source is built, whatever `index.js` is serving is updated, without affecting the runtime of `index.js` itself! So, I am nearly approaching a fully integrated build system that was all custom built. :smile:\n\n## Other Fun stuff\n\nYou know how when your `npm start` wont work, only because of a missing module? I've always been like, well, the _single_ solution here _is to just install the friggen module_ Well, thanks to stdout, we can try to read those missing modules, install it, and try `npm start` again. This is something I am working on.\n\nYou'll notice a lot of the code is parsing `stdout` as strings - I realize out to an infinite time scale, this isn't a most robust way of checking error messages, so I'm working towards parsing the actual errors codes from Nodejs and reacting from those, instead of the error text itself.\n\nYou may have also noticed the function messageHub for nearly every logging type message. Indeed, we do log to the console, but I built this hub-type function so we could add more ways of messaging, one of them is through a Slack bot, which I show how to do in [Part 4](https://chrisfrew.in/fully-automating-chrisfrew-in-productions-part-4-of-building-a-slack-bot/)\n\nYou'll see I have logging util and twitter util functions commented out - they are coming - all with good time!\n\n## To Do List\n\nI've still got to add all my other sites to the monitor - this is just a matter adding to that key:value that the server monitors - see `oRepositoryPathValuePairs` in the code below for what I am talking about.\n\nWhat will be really cool is for the GitHub monitor to update itself when it sees that it's remote - yes, this is like some Terminator-level crap. This will be a special case, because in order for a flawless execution of the monitor server itself, it would have to spawn a child process of itself, then update its code, then start itself, finally killing the child process of its older version.\n\n## Full code\n\n`index.js`\n```javascript\n'use strict'; // strict\n\n// external library requires\nconst express = require('express');\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\nconst crypto = require('crypto');\nconst app = express();\nconst twitterBotUtils = require('../chrisfrew.in-productions-shared-functions/utils/twitterBotUtils.js');\nconst simpleGit = require('simple-git');\nconst git = simpleGit();\nconst axios = require('axios');\nconst exec = require('child_process').exec;\n\n// fixed port on dell\nconst iPort = 8087;\nconst oRepositoryPathValuePairs = {\n  \"charge-keyboard-splash-page\": \"../charge-keyboard.com\",\n  \"chrisfrew.in-productions-github-bitbucket-monitor\": \"\", // super meta - will restart itself\n}\n\n// The GitHub webhook MUST be configured to be sent as \"application/json\"\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n\n// Verification function to check if it is actually GitHub who is POSTing here\nconst verifySignature = (req) => {\n  if (!req.headers['user-agent'].includes('GitHub-Hookshot')) {\n    return false;\n  }\n  // Compare their hmac signature to our hmac signature\n  // (hmac = hash-based message authentication code)\n  const sExternalSignature = req.headers['x-hub-signature'];\n  const oData = JSON.stringify(req.body);\n  const sSecret = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET; \n  const sInternalSignature = `sha1=${crypto.createHmac('sha1', sSecret).update(oData).digest('hex')}`;\n  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(sExternalSignature), Buffer.from(sInternalSignature));\n};\n\nconst determineWebhook = (oData) => {\n  let sStatus;\n  if (oData.sender) { // GitHub\n    sStatus = \"New head commit in \" + oData.repository.name + \" (\" + oData.repository.url + \"): \" + oData.head_commit.committer.name;\n    if (oData.head_commit.added)  {\n      sStatus = sStatus + \" added \" + oData.head_commit.added.length + \" files, \";\n    }\n    if (oData.head_commit.modified)  {\n      sStatus = sStatus +  \" modified \" + oData.head_commit.modified.length + \" files, and\";\n    }\n    if (oData.head_commit.removed) {\n      sStatus = sStatus +  \" removed \" + oData.head_commit.removed.length + \" files.\";\n    }\n   console.log(sStatus);\n   messageHub(\"Attempting to pull from this repository...\");\n   pull(oRepositoryPathValuePairs[oData.repository.name]);\n    //twitterBotUtils.postStatus(sStatus);\n  } else if (oData.actor) { // Bitbucket\n    \n    //twitterBotUtils.postStatus(sStatus);\n  } else { // some other webhook (there are no others yet)\n    \n  }\n\n};\nconst pull = (sRootRepositoryDirectory) => {\n  git.cwd(sRootRepositoryDirectory).pull((err, update) => {\n     if(update && update.summary.changes) { // there is indeed an update found on the remote\n        messageHub(\"This is an app templated by create-react-app; We need to issue 'npm run build' to build new source...\");\n        build();\n     } else if (err) {\n       if (err.includes(\"commit your changes or stash them\")) {\n         messageHub(\"Changes need to be stashed; stashing automatically...\");\n         stashAndPull(sRootRepositoryDirectory);\n       }// TODO: more error cases? ...\n     }\n  });\n}\nconst stashAndPull = (sRootRepositoryDirectory) => {\n  git.cwd(sRootRepositoryDirectory).stash()\n    .then(() => {\n      messageHub(\"Stash succesfull, attempting to pull again...\");\n      pull(sRootRepositoryDirectory);\n    });\n}\nconst build = () => {\n  exec('npm run build', { cwd: '../charge-keyboard.com' }, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n     if (err) {\n       messageHub(err);\n     } else if (stderr) {\n       messageHub(stderr);\n     } else {\n       messageHub(\"Build command successfully sent.

        "content": "\n## Hey, Want to be an American living in Austria and working in Liechtenstein?\n## Look no further!\n\nThis is a detailed how-to guide on applying and obtaining:\n- An Austrian residence permit\n- A Liechtensteiner work permit\n\n## The Task\n\nWarning: this process took me over two months. I want to share first how I did it, and then how I should have done it in hopes to save others time if they should wish to attempt tackling this debauchery of paperwork and bureaucracy.*\n\n<sup>\\* Trust me when I say I'm not a legal counsel so always take my words with a grain of salt. However, as of February 2016, these were the steps I took to get started working. UPDATE 2017: The process is still the same as described here. I know this because you have to renew your permits each year for your first three years in Austria. Granted, it is much easier the second and third times as you have all of your papers in place already from the previous year!</sup>\n\n## Overview\n\nWhen you plan on living in Austria for longer than three months, and then longer than sixth months (there are some other special visas such as a student visa, artist visa which last for sixth months), then the government requires you to apply for a Niedlerlassungsbewilligung, a specific type of Aufenhaltstitel, or residence permit, very similar to a green card in the US. Then, Liechtenstein requires that you have Aufenhaltstitel, or a working permit to legally work in Liechtenstein. Your company should help you with this process, and, since a cross border working permit for Liechtenstein is very common, the application is relatively simple compared to the Niedlerlassungsbewilligung.\n\n## Legal Entities\n\nThere are four legal entities you are going to need to work with to get everything to jive:\n1. Perhaps most important, is the Bezirkshauptmannschaft, or \"BH\" for short in German, or in English, the district authority. This is where you will complete your Niedlerlassungsbewilligung, or residence permit.\n2. Another place you will visit is the Gemeindeamt, or town hall of the town your apartment is in. This is where you will make your Meldezettel, or certification of registration. When you do this registration, you want to make your Haupwohnsitz, or main place of residence to that town.\n3. You will also need to work with the Besitzer, or the owner of the apartment. If the apartment you want to rent is a private, this shouldn't be so difficult. Unfortunately, it is quite common in Austria that apartments are owned by an apartment company, so you may have to work with one of those companies to finally get the rent contract and the signature of the official owner of the building itself.\n4. Finally, the two documents you will need to send from Liechtenstein are mandated by the Besitzer Ausländer- und Passamt, or the Immigration and Passport Office of Liechtenstein.\nLong Term Residence Permit(Nieder- lassungs- bewilligung)\nFor the residence permit, fill out the Niedlerlassungsbewilligung application. If you already have your apartment, you should even be able to fill in those parts as well. If you don't have a spouse or children, you can skip many parts of this application. Anyways, the BH will look over it when you first supply it to them anyway, so don't stress too much.\nTo fully complete the Niedlerlassungsbewilligung application, you will need to bring the following documents when you go to the BH:\n\n## Original Documents\n\n1. Passport photo (glue it right on the front page of the application)\n2. Your birth certificate, signed by an apostle\n3. A police report from you local police station listing an infractions you may or may not have, also signed by an apostle\n4. Your (at the lowest) A1 German proficiency certificate\n\n## Copied Documents\n\n1. Your rent agreement, make sure the copy has the signature of owner of the apartment building\n2. Flight confirmation ticket (so the BH knows how long you have to legally stay in Austria)\n3. A police report from you local police station listing an infractions you may or may not have, also signed by an apostle\n4. Your A1 certification in German. This is exam is not to be taken lightly! I did it through the Goethe Institut in U.S.\n5. Your work contract - make sure all the work contracts have signatures.\n6. A \"simulation\" of your wage with expected taxes from Austria - make sure this has signatures from your company as well.\nWork Permit(Arbeits- bewilligung)\nFor the work permit, you will need to fill out the Stellanantritt ohne Wohnsitznahme in Liechtenstein and Persönliche Angabe zur Ausstellung des Aufenhaltstitels applications. Your company in Liechtenstein may send you these half completed, or they may not. Mine did.\nTo fully complete the applications, you will need the following attachments:\n\n## Original Documents\n\n1. Passport photo (glue it right on the front page of the Persönliche Angabe zur Ausstellung des Aufenhaltstitels)\n \nAnd... that's it. Just the passport photo. Told you it was cake compared to the residence permit.\nThe Perfect Process\nNow, some of the things you have seen above may not really make any sense to you. The list below will describe them and outline, if you were perfect, how you could complete the entire process without any confusion or wasting of time:\n\n## Before Going to Austria\n\n1. Get a job offer in Liechtenstein! The company will send you contracts which you need to sign in the presence of an apostle, which you will then send back to the company for their final approval. They'll then order the contracts which you need to fill out for Liechtenstein.\n2. Pass your German A1 Proficiency Exam and wait for certificate to be mailed to you (this is probably easier before you go to Austria, but not impossible to do in Austria or Germany). This exam is includes basic reading, writing, and speaking in German. I did mine through the Goethe Institut. More about it here.\n\n## Once In Austria\n\n1. Obtain an Austrian Bank Account (this takes a few days because they always need to approve foreigners) this will help time saving immensely with any bank transfers you need for the apartment, such as the security deposit or first months rent.\n2. Aggressively hunt for an apartment, get the rent contract made up and sign it with the owner of the apartment as soon as you can. (This process took me a month.)\n3. In the meantime of all the apartment hunting, get a bunch of passport photos taken. You will need them for a few things later on.\n4. Make your Meldezettal, or certification of registration at your local  Gemindeamt or town hall (make sure to bring your rent contract when you go!)\n5. Go to the BH with all of the documents listed above. If you're good (unlike me) and have all the documents when you go, you should need to go only once.\n6. Now, this step is tricky. Liechtenstein won't issue you a work permit without first seeing your residence permit (would be easy if you were an EU citizen - they would issue it as soon as they knew you were a citizen!) However, Austria won't issue you a residence permit without first seeing the work permit! Catch 22 right? Well, not exactly. When you have everything ready for your residence permit at the BH, you can get help from your company and the Liechtenstein government to send a short confirmation letter saying that yes, as soon as you have your residence permit, they will issue you a work permit if you send in your residence permit for them to examine.\n7. Now wait. Some district authority offices say it can take as long as six months to approve your residence permit. I personally think that it depends more on your start date. I don't think they will toast you and make you wait for months if they see your start date is coming up in just a few weeks or month.\n8. Then, eventually, the BH will call you and tell you when you can pick up your residence permit! You will have to go this time with your passport and pay a final 20 EUR to receive the residence permit. They told me to come back on a date about a week after I finally submitted everything.\n9. Then, you will need to work with your company. The authorities in Liechtenstein will need to see that residence permit that you just got, with those two other documents I mentioned above. Probably with yet another week, then will then issue you the work permit. I picked my work permit up from my company, but maybe they sometimes mail it. I'm not sure.\n10. Finally, you've done it! Hike up to a hut, sip a delicious Austrian beer and eat a big Germknödel! Try not to think about after all that paperwork your only reward is to start working!\n \n \n \n",

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\n## Hey, Want to be an American living in Austria and working in Liechtenstein?\n## Look no further!\n\nThis is a detailed how-to guide on applying and obtaining:\n- An Austrian residence permit\n- A Liechtensteiner work permit\n\n## The Task\n\nWarning: this process took me over two months. I want to share first how I did it, and then how I should have done it in hopes to save others time if they should wish to attempt tackling this debauchery of paperwork and bureaucracy.*\n\n<sup>\\* Trust me when I say I'm not a legal counsel so always take my words with a grain of salt. However, as of February 2016, these were the steps I took to get started working. UPDATE 2017: The process is still the same as described here. I know this because you have to renew your permits each year for your first three years in Austria. Granted, it is much easier the second and third times as you have all of your papers in place already from the previous year!</sup>\n\n## Overview\n\nWhen you plan on living in Austria for longer than three months, and then longer than sixth months (there are some other special visas such as a student visa, artist visa which last for sixth months), then the government requires you to apply for a Niedlerlassungsbewilligung, a specific type of Aufenhaltstitel, or residence permit, very similar to a green card in the US. Then, Liechtenstein requires that you have Aufenhaltstitel, or a working permit to legally work in Liechtenstein. Your company should help you with this process, and, since a cross border working permit for Liechtenstein is very common, the application is relatively simple compared to the Niedlerlassungsbewilligung.\n\n## Legal Entities\n\nThere are four legal entities you are going to need to work with to get everything to jive:\n1. Perhaps most important, is the Bezirkshauptmannschaft, or \"BH\" for short in German, or in English, the district authority. This is where you will complete your Niedlerlassungsbewilligung, or residence permit.\n2. Another place you will visit is the Gemeindeamt, or town hall of the town your apartment is in. This is where you will make your Meldezettel, or certification of registration. When you do this registration, you want to make your Haupwohnsitz, or main place of residence to that town.\n3. You will also need to work with the Besitzer, or the owner of the apartment. If the apartment you want to rent is a private, this shouldn't be so difficult. Unfortunately, it is quite common in Austria that apartments are owned by an apartment company, so you may have to work with one of those companies to finally get the rent contract and the signature of the official owner of the building itself.\n4. Finally, the two documents you will need to send from Liechtenstein are mandated by the Besitzer Ausländer- und Passamt, or the Immigration and Passport Office of Liechtenstein.\nLong Term Residence Permit(Nieder- lassungs- bewilligung)\nFor the residence permit, fill out the Niedlerlassungsbewilligung application. If you already have your apartment, you should even be able to fill in those parts as well. If you don't have a spouse or children, you can skip many parts of this application. Anyways, the BH will look over it when you first supply it to them anyway, so don't stress too much.\nTo fully complete the Niedlerlassungsbewilligung application, you will need to bring the following documents when you go to the BH:\n\n## Original Documents\n\n1. Passport photo (glue it right on the front page of the application)\n2. Your birth certificate, signed by an apostle\n3. A police report from you local police station listing an infractions you may or may not have, also signed by an apostle\n4. Your (at the lowest) A1 German proficiency certificate\n\n## Copied Documents\n\n1. Your rent agreement, make sure the copy has the signature of owner of the apartment building\n2. Flight confirmation ticket (so the BH knows how long you have to legally stay in Austria)\n3. A police report from you local police station listing an infractions you may or may not have, also signed by an apostle\n4. Your A1 certification in German. This is exam is not to be taken lightly! I did it through the Goethe Institut in U.S.\n5. Your work contract - make sure all the work contracts have signatures.\n6. A \"simulation\" of your wage with expected taxes from Austria - make sure this has signatures from your company as well.\nWork Permit(Arbeits- bewilligung)\nFor the work permit, you will need to fill out the Stellanantritt ohne Wohnsitznahme in Liechtenstein and Persönliche Angabe zur Ausstellung des Aufenhaltstitels applications. Your company in Liechtenstein may send you these half completed, or they may not. Mine did.\nTo fully complete the applications, you will need the following attachments:\n\n## Original Documents\n\n1. Passport photo (glue it right on the front page of the Persönliche Angabe zur Ausstellung des Aufenhaltstitels)\n \nAnd... that's it. Just the passport photo. Told you it was cake compared to the residence permit.\nThe Perfect Process\nNow, some of the things you have seen above may not really make any sense to you. The list below will describe them and outline, if you were perfect, how you could complete the entire process without any confusion or wasting of time:\n\n## Before Going to Austria\n\n1. Get a job offer in Liechtenstein! The company will send you contracts which you need to sign in the presence of an apostle, which you will then send back to the company for their final approval. They'll then order the contracts which you need to fill out for Liechtenstein.\n2. Pass your German A1 Proficiency Exam and wait for certificate to be mailed to you (this is probably easier before you go to Austria, but not impossible to do in Austria or Germany). This exam is includes basic reading, writing, and speaking in German. I did mine through the Goethe Institut. More about it here.\n\n## Once In Austria\n\n1. Obtain an Austrian Bank Account (this takes a few days because they always need to approve foreigners) this will help time saving immensely with any bank transfers you need for the apartment, such as the security deposit or first months rent.\n2. Aggressively hunt for an apartment, get the rent contract made up and sign it with the owner of the apartment as soon as you can. (This process took me a month.)\n3. In the meantime of all the apartment hunting, get a bunch of passport photos taken. You will need them for a few things later on.\n4. Make your Meldezettal, or certification of registration at your local  Gemindeamt or town hall (make sure to bring your rent contract when you go!)\n5. Go to the BH with all of the documents listed above. If you're good (unlike me) and have all the documents when you go, you should need to go only once.\n6. Now, this step is tricky. Liechtenstein won't issue you a work permit without first seeing your residence permit (would be easy if you were an EU citizen - they would issue it as soon as they knew you were a citizen!) However, Austria won't issue you a residence permit without first seeing the work permit! Catch 22 right? Well, not exactly.

However, while it gives me more hope personally, I think this post is still extremely relevant (one blog donation is of course not going to )</i><sup>\n\n# Ads, Companies, Creators, Makers, the Network Effect, and Redistribution\n\nAnd no, before you think where this post is going, this post isn't going to be a crypto rant about how fiat is bad or governments printing money control our lives and blah blah blah.\n\nNo, this post is going to be about the culture around payments, donations, and transactions in general online - and what could be a revolution and explosion in creativity.\n\nI've been mulling over this thread of thought for months now. After enough rumination, I've finally been able to pull it all together into this fairly large post. I've collected a variety of fairly recent sources that show these issue shows some strong trends and is coming to a point and predictions for the future.\n\nI start off with what is going on with creators or creative entities - whether companies or individual Makers (all credit to [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com) for that term 😉), and then shifting to how everything appears to us, modern day consumers. I finish with a prescribed solution to the problem, and things that I am continuing to consider, even after distilling my thoughts into this post.\n\nThis is a longer, non-dev post of mine, but I think these are very important issues that need to be discussed more often. So grab a ☕ and put your thinking cap on!\n\n## Advertisements and the Network Effect Perspective of Companies, Creators and Makers\n\n### The Network Effect \n\nA very important paper that was one of the first items that got me thinking along the lines of these issues is this paper about the role of luck. While it is aimed at individuals, if a company or organization is considered as an individual in the market, many of the same findings and principles can apply.\n\nSo the paper found that . Unfortunately, most intelligent (or even most hard working!) were not those\n\nSince the researches had of course total control over the experiment, and as the second half. _This redistribution is exactly the issue I am going to get at in this post_\n\nBut wait you say, the internet is by definition a giant sharing and redistribution network. Indeed, but let's be honest, it's the sharing and redistribution of _information_, not money. \n\n### The subscription based web\n\nTo understand why redistribution hasn't been monetary based and only information based, we have to look at the companies that define the internet right now. \n\nLet's look at a concrete example by way of monthly subscription style services I've been thinking of subscribing to, but haven't because I'm too much of a cheapo:\n\n- $4 / mo. New Yorker Subscription (\"just\" $1 a week as their add states!!! 😑 )\n- $5 / mo. Medium membership (yeah, the free version is not enough for me - I read a lot of people's stuff)\n- $6.67 / mo. The Economist (subscription itself is 12 weeks = 3 months, for $20)\n- $5.99 / mo. Reddit Premium\n\nSo... that adds up to nearly $16 a month, or $192 a year!\n\nand this is a conservative list - these are just the subscriptions that I'm toying with / have to deal with.\n\nAs I I'm currently debating if I myself should subscribe to these services (see? I too am a self prophesizing problem of this issue!)\n\nI don't argue that $1 a month or even $5 a month is too much for a single service. I guess what I'm trying to argue is that these profits go to big companies that benefit from subscribers and can benefit from their geometric self-fed network affect. Then these companies grow, and in order to grow their revenue they have to resort to one thing to keep growth metrics alive:\n\n**They use ads!**\n\n### The Ad-Death of the Modern Social Network Company\n<sup>See: [The heat death of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe)</sup>\n\nA joke I tell is picturing the end result of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and the like, will be only a constant stream of - not of what is going on with your family and friends' life - but of ads!\n\nBut then what? We've seen what happens as soon as Wall Street even gets wind of a decrease in earnings in the future. \n\n### Hope for Non-commercial Social Networks\n\nWhat encourages me is what I've seen through [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com), in that groups of passionate developers (dev.to is a great example)\n\nIn these types of Social Web 3.0, the ads to me are a means to end: they keep the service up. In this case, the model is that members of the network come first, whereas (nowadays on Twitter and Facebook), it seems like the opposite is true: powerful tools and, while the 'member' of the network was bombarded with ads that, while it may indeed be targeted to the user's interests, is none-the-less approaching spam levels.\n\nAnother hope is the new generation Y is more charity product aware than any generation before. They are looking now, not even for companies and individuals that donate, but actively participate. I suppose from a Maker perspective, these are people who are actively contributing to online communities, podcasts, and blog posts, sharing their \n\n## The Consumer's Perspective\n\nFrom the consumer's perspective, the current outlook of the economy supporting the internet is just as grim. Facebook is a prime example. I haven't used Facebook for three years now, but I've looked over the shoulder of my buddy, and immediately noticed something, astounded: \"what? its just all ads!\" \n\nMy buddy, sounding already very used to this deluge, replied \"yep, facebook is just all ads now dude\". \n\nMy brother, graduating with his bachelor's degree this year (so just inside the start generation Y), says that he and his friends use facebook only mostly for events now, also because of this over-ad reason.\n\nAnother Maker, Justin Jackson brings up another brilliant point is that with all these ads, the user is overwhelmed, and in Justin's words 'exhausted' from the constant bombardment of the next big thing.\n\nIts true: while the consumer these days is empowered with making, this requires that producst be very useful, very unique, and with stories behind them. Printing some text on a t-shirt isn't going to cut it in this next generation of the economy.\n\n# The Solution(s)\n\nHOWEVER\n\nWhat if we thought of the cash flow like this: What if (I've checked multiple blogs that posted, for example, a Bitcoin or Ethereum address - they all have 0 transactions)\n\nSuch a model could be applied to anything.\n\nThere were groups trying to build such microtransaction systems (yes, even before crypto currency):\n\n## The dawn of the redistribution company\n\nThere's another neat way to solve this. Let's make an example: \n\nChris sells widgets. Each widget Chris sells would normally provide him with $10 in profit. But what if Chris redistributes the profits from every widget sold to anyone who has every bought the widget - including Chris himself! Of course the profits I realize will become marginally smaller the more people that buy my 'widget'... so, is this the very definition of a pyramid scheme? I don't think so, because I'm distrubiting everything equally. The only problem is still the issue of early adopters - they will benefit financially the most, while some of the people to purchase the product last.  To some this may sound eerily 'communist'. But whats the alternative? A mere handful of companies reaping (Okay, to be fair, according to Bruce Upbin at Forbes and three systems theorists from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, [40% of the wealth is controlled by 147 companies, and 80% if controlled by 737](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2011/10/22/the-147-companies-that-control-everything/#1f58903f5105). Meanwhile, 10 companies control 80% of the media.\n\nAnyway, lets do the math on such a scenario. I think its a bit weird to immediately get the refund back from your purchase, so lets consider the redistribution at the end of \n\nStill, this has the same structure as a corporate structure, also showing similiar effects like the cryptocurrency phase, in that early . Still, I think this method is in the right direction of creative and Maker wealth redistribution in my dream of our 'new economy'.\n\nYou're probably thinking at this point, \"this guy is crazy; I'm not going to read his blog anymore\". Good ma'am or sir, I laugh at you! No, to me, the prospect of having a huge economy where experts of all shapes and sizes can thrive based off donations and commission work. \n\ndAnd, as I've stated frequently, being a software developer who is interested and always willing to learn in 2018, I will never be short of having a 'job that pays the bills', although the vision in this post is to create an economy where that wont be needed anyway. 😉\n\n## My Pledge\n\nPosting this giant post with all talk and no action would be pretty lame. Therefore. 90% of all donations to this site, will be recycled into the maker and creative economy of s this includes:\n\n- Sam Harris's Waking Up Podcast\n- Dan Carlin's Hardcore History (Which he made free and by volunteer donation only - excellent!)\n- The GatsbyJS Team - fantastic work they are doing - also and example of the full tool which is totally free and donations are optional\n- The `create-react-app` Team - another invaluable tool for developers like me who use React JS.\n\nI'm building out a page to track these recycled cash flows. I'm paying it forward in hopes to speed up my dream of a maker economy reality.\n\n## Future Considerations and More Work\n\nBut this project seems to have died out. This is an issue that I repeatedly think about, and will likely blog again.\n\nAs I build out my arsenal of projects as a Maker (all credit to (https://producthunt.com)[Product Hunt] for that term), I think I will be opting for the one time charge - or in the worst case, a yearly subscription. \n\nA common complaint by software engineers is that they don't work on projects that are challenging and ground breaking, or for companies that by nature aren't pushing the cutting edge. This issue was discussed in depth in a Hacker News thread.\n\nThat the very nature of the network effect is a root cause of this issue. \n\nIf we want smart people to have the freedom and security to work freely on large scale 'moonshot' projects (regardless of discipline - this applies to the arts, sciences, engineering, software - you name it) we _have_ to be more open to supporting creators. I picture a world of networked freelancers all striving, while also volunteering time to contribute to open source versions of the things that we use Perhaps I'm missing something that isn't feasible, but to me, its the solution of all the problems raised in this post.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nHere are some other high quality pieces I think are worth reading, but couldn't find a way to incorporate them smoothly into this post:\n\n[Wait but Why - How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You)](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html)\n\n\nCheers! 🍺\n\nChris",

I've collected a variety of fairly recent sources that show these issue shows some strong trends and is coming to a point and predictions for the future.\n\nI start off with what is going on with creators or creative entities - whether companies or individual Makers (all credit to [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com) for that term :wink:), and then shifting to how everything appears to us, modern day consumers. I finish with a prescribed solution to the problem, and things that I am continuing to consider, even after distilling my thoughts into this post.\n\nThis is a longer, non-dev post of mine, but I think these are very important issues that need to be discussed more often. So grab a :coffee: and put your thinking cap on!\n\n## Advertisements and the Network Effect Perspective of Companies, Creators and Makers\n\n### The Network Effect \n\nA very important paper that was one of the first items that got me thinking along the lines of these issues is this paper about the role of luck. While it is aimed at individuals, if a company or organization is considered as an individual in the market, many of the same findings and principles can apply.\n\nSo the paper found that . Unfortunately, most intelligent (or even most hard working!) were not those\n\nSince the researches had of course total control over the experiment, and as the second half. _This redistribution is exactly the issue I am going to get at in this post_\n\nBut wait you say, the internet is by definition a giant sharing and redistribution network. Indeed, but let's be honest, it's the sharing and redistribution of _information_, not money. \n\n### The subscription based web\n\nTo understand why redistribution hasn't been monetary based and only information based, we have to look at the companies that define the internet right now. \n\nLet's look at a concrete example by way of monthly subscription style services I've been thinking of subscribing to, but haven't because I'm too much of a cheapo:\n\n- $4 / mo. New Yorker Subscription (\"just\" $1 a week as their add states!!! 😑 )\n- $5 / mo. Medium membership (yeah, the free version is not enough for me - I read a lot of people's stuff)\n- $6.67 / mo. The Economist (subscription itself is 12 weeks = 3 months, for $20)\n- $5.99 / mo. Reddit Premium\n\nSo... that adds up to nearly $16 a month, or $192 a year!\n\nand this is a conservative list - these are just the subscriptions that I'm toying with / have to deal with.\n\nAs I I'm currently debating if I myself should subscribe to these services (see? I too am a self prophesizing problem of this issue!)\n\nI don't argue that $1 a month or even $5 a month is too much for a single service. I guess what I'm trying to argue is that these profits go to big companies that benefit from subscribers and can benefit from their geometric self-fed network affect. Then these companies grow, and in order to grow their revenue they have to resort to one thing to keep growth metrics alive:\n\n**They use ads!**\n\n### The Ad-Death of the Modern Social Network Company\n<sup>See: [The heat death of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe)</sup>\n\nA joke I tell is picturing the end result of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and the like, will be only a constant stream of - not of what is going on with your family and friends' life - but of ads!\n\nBut then what? We've seen what happens as soon as Wall Street even gets wind of a decrease in earnings in the future. \n\n### Hope for Non-commercial Social Networks\n\nWhat encourages me is what I've seen through [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com), in that groups of passionate developers (dev.to is a great example)\n\nIn these types of Social Web 3.0, the ads to me are a means to end: they keep the service up. In this case, the model is that members of the network come first, whereas (nowadays on Twitter and Facebook), it seems like the opposite is true: powerful tools and, while the 'member' of the network was bombarded with ads that, while it may indeed be targeted to the user's interests, is none-the-less approaching spam levels.\n\nAnother hope is the new generation Y is more charity product aware than any generation before. They are looking now, not even for companies and individuals that donate, but actively participate. I suppose from a Maker perspective, these are people who are actively contributing to online communities, podcasts, and blog posts, sharing their \n\n## The Consumer's Perspective\n\nFrom the consumer's perspective, the current outlook of the economy supporting the internet is just as grim. Facebook is a prime example. I haven't used Facebook for three years now, but I've looked over the shoulder of my buddy, and immediately noticed something, astounded: \"what? its just all ads!\" \n\nMy buddy, sounding already very used to this deluge, replied \"yep, facebook is just all ads now dude\". \n\nMy brother, graduating with his bachelor's degree this year (so just inside the start generation Y), says that he and his friends use facebook only mostly for events now, also because of this over-ad reason.\n\nAnother Maker, Justin Jackson brings up another brilliant point is that with all these ads, the user is overwhelmed, and in Justin's words 'exhausted' from the constant bombardment of the next big thing.\n\nIts true: while the consumer these days is empowered with making, this requires that producst be very useful, very unique, and with stories behind them. Printing some text on a t-shirt isn't going to cut it in this next generation of the economy.\n\n# The Solution(s)\n\nHOWEVER\n\nWhat if we thought of the cash flow like this: What if (I've checked multiple blogs that posted, for example, a Bitcoin or Ethereum address - they all have 0 transactions)\n\nSuch a model could be applied to anything.\n\nThere were groups trying to build such microtransaction systems (yes, even before crypto currency):\n\n## The dawn of the redistribution company\n\nThere's another neat way to solve this. Let's make an example: \n\nChris sells widgets. Each widget Chris sells would normally provide him with $10 in profit. But what if Chris redistributes the profits from every widget sold to anyone who has every bought the widget - including Chris himself! Of course the profits I realize will become marginally smaller the more people that buy my 'widget'... so, is this the very definition of a pyramid scheme? I don't think so, because I'm distrubiting everything equally. The only problem is still the issue of early adopters - they will benefit financially the most, while some of the people to purchase the product last.  To some this may sound eerily 'communist'. But whats the alternative? A mere handful of companies reaping (Okay, to be fair, according to Bruce Upbin at Forbes and three systems theorists from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, [40% of the wealth is controlled by 147 companies, and 80% if controlled by 737](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2011/10/22/the-147-companies-that-control-everything/#1f58903f5105). Meanwhile, 10 companies control 80% of the media.\n\nAnyway, lets do the math on such a scenario. I think its a bit weird to immediately get the refund back from your purchase, so lets consider the redistribution at the end of \n\nStill, this has the same structure as a corporate structure, also showing similiar effects like the cryptocurrency phase, in that early . Still, I think this method is in the right direction of creative and Maker wealth redistribution in my dream of our 'new economy'.\n\nYou're probably thinking at this point, \"this guy is crazy; I'm not going to read his blog anymore\". Good ma'am or sir, I laugh at you! No, to me, the prospect of having a huge economy where experts of all shapes and sizes can thrive based off donations and commission work. \n\ndAnd, as I've stated frequently, being a software developer who is interested and always willing to learn in 2018, I will never be short of having a 'job that pays the bills', although the vision in this post is to create an economy where that wont be needed anyway. :wink:\n\n## My Pledge\n\nPosting this giant post with all talk and no action would be pretty lame. Therefore. 90% of all donations to this site, will be recycled into the maker and creative economy of s this includes:\n\n- Sam Harris's Waking Up Podcast\n- Dan Carlin's Hardcore History (Which he made free and by volunteer donation only - excellent!)\n- The GatsbyJS Team - fantastic work they are doing - also and example of the full tool which is totally free and donations are optional\n- The `create-react-app` Team - another invaluable tool for developers like me who use React JS.\n\nI'm building out a page to track these recycled cash flows. I'm paying it forward in hopes to speed up my dream of a maker economy reality.\n\n## Future Considerations and More Work\n\nBut this project seems to have died out. This is an issue that I repeatedly think about, and will likely blog again.\n\nAs I build out my arsenal of projects as a Maker (all credit to (https://producthunt.com)[Product Hunt] for that term), I think I will be opting for the one time charge - or in the worst case, a yearly subscription. \n\nA common complaint by software engineers is that they don't work on projects that are challenging and ground breaking, or for companies that by nature aren't pushing the cutting edge. This issue was discussed in depth in a Hacker News thread.\n\nThat the very nature of the network effect is a root cause of this issue. \n\nIf we want smart people to have the freedom and security to work freely on large scale 'moonshot' projects (regardless of discipline - this applies to the arts, sciences, engineering, software - you name it) we _have_ to be more open to supporting creators. I picture a world of networked freelancers all striving, while also volunteering time to contribute to open source versions of the things that we use Perhaps I'm missing something that isn't feasible, but to me, its the solution of all the problems raised in this post.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nHere are some other high quality pieces I think are worth reading, but couldn't find a way to incorporate them smoothly into this post:\n\n[Wait but Why - How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You)](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html)\n\n\nCheers! :beer:\n\nChris",

This naturally has gotten me listening to Led Zeppelin again as well, and I've even been getting back to writing a few classic rock style tunes with my acoustic guitar. This was a neat little project I threw together in order to try to generate some new lyrics, and also to see what could make those Led Zeppelin / Greta Van Fleet lyrics just so... _zepplin-ey_ 😄\n\n## Important: I'm Lazy.\n\nYep, if anyone out there has been following along in my blogging adventures, you'll know that I'm lazy. Anything that can be automated, I'm going to try to automate it! (Or in the very least, partially automate it or find a tool to use to make my life easier.) Actually, the entire concept of this post reflects my laziness: I'm willing to make a tool that generates lyrics _for_ me before I visit my buddy this summer as we prepare to write an EP together! (Yikes! - I'll let you know how _that_ goes!)\n\n## Getting the List of Song Names\n\nThere's this neat tool that I found that extracts lists from Wikipedia pages: http://wikitable2csv.ggor.de/, built by Gregor Weichbrodt. Nice one, Gregor! And... (yes you can see where this is going) of course, Wikipedia has a list for everything <sup>TM</sup> (no, that is not actually trademarked) And guess what? They have a \"List of songs recorded by Led Zeppelin\" page! [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_songs\\_recorded\\_by\\_Led\\_Zeppelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_recorded_by_Led_Zeppelin)\n\nThrow that into Gregor's tool, and you've got your .csv data, which with 5 seconds work with Sublime text, becomes our song list:\n\n```python\nlSongNames = [\"10 Ribs & All/Carrot Pod Pod\",\n\"Achilles Last Stand\",\n\"All My Love\",\n\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\",\n\"Baby Come On Home\" ,\n\"Bathroom Sound\",\n\"The Battle of Evermore\",\n\"Black Country Woman\",\n\"Black Dog\",\n\"Black Mountain Side\",\n\"Blot\",\n\"Bonzo's Montreux\",\n\"Boogie with Stu\",\n\"Brandy & Coke\",\n\"Bring It On Home\",\n\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\",\n\"Bron-Yr-Aur\",\n\"Candy Store Rock\",\n\"Carouselambra\",\n\"Celebration Day\",\n\"Communication Breakdown\",\n\"The Crunge\",\n\"Custard Pie\",\n\"C'mon Everybody\",\n\"Dancing Days\",\n\"Darlene\",\n\"Dazed and Confused\",\n\"Desire\",\n\"Down by the Seaside\",\n\"Driving Through Kashmir\",\n\"D'yer Mak'er\",\n\"The Epic\",\n\"Everybody Makes It Through\",\n\"Fool in the Rain\",\n\"For Your Life\",\n\"Four Sticks\",\n\"Four Hands\",\n\"Friends\",\n\"Gallows Pole\",\n\"The Girl I Love She Got Long Black Wavy Hair\",\n\"Going to California\",\n\"Good Times Bad Times\",\n\"Hats Off to (Roy) Harper\",\n\"Heartbreaker\",\n\"Hey, Hey, What Can I Do\",\n\"The Hook\",\n\"Hot Dog\",\n\"Hots On for Nowhere\",\n\"Houses of the Holy\",\n\"How Many More Times\",\n\"I Can't Quit You Baby\",\n\"If It Keeps On Raining\",\n\"I'm Gonna Crawl\",\n\"Immigrant Song\",\n\"In My Time of Dying\",\n\"In the Evening\",\n\"In the Light\",\n\"Jennings Farm Blues\",\n\"Kashmir\",\n\"Key to the Highway/Trouble in Mind\",\n\"LA Drone\",\n\"La La\",\n\"The Lemon Song\",\n\"Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)\",\n\"Misty Mountain Hop\",\n\"Moby Dick\",\n\"Night Flight\",\n\"Nobody's Fault but Mine\",\n\"No Quarter\",\n\"The Ocean\",\n\"Out on the Tiles\",\n\"Over the Hills and Far Away\",\n\"Ozone Baby\",\n\"Poor Tom\",\n\"The Rain Song\",\n\"Ramble On\",\n\"Rock and Roll\",\n\"The Rover\",\n\"Royal Orleans\",\n\"Sick Again\",\n\"Since I've Been Loving You\",\n\"Somethin' Else\",\n\"The Song Remains the Same\",\n\"South Bound Saurez\",\n\"Southbound Piano\",\n\"St. Tristan's Sword\",\n\"Stairway to Heaven\",\n\"Sugar Mama\",\n\"Sunshine Woman\",\n\"Tangerine\",\n\"Tea for One\",\n\"Ten Years Gone\",\n\"Thank You\",\n\"That's the Way\",\n\"Trampled Under Foot\",\n\"Travelling Riverside Blues\",\n\"Two Ones Are Won\",\n\"Walter's Walk\",\n\"The Wanton Song\",\n\"Wearing and Tearing\",\n\"We're Gonna Groove\",\n\"What Is and What Should Never Be\",\n\"When the Levee Breaks\",\n\"White Summer/Black Mountain Side\",\n\"Whole Lotta Love\",\n\"You Shook Me\",\n\"Your Time Is Gonna Come\"]\n```\n\n## Getting Lyrics for Each Song\n\nSo great, we've got our list of songs in Python syntax. We need the actual _lyrics_ now. And yes, I'm going to continue this post's laziness theme! I could go to Google, copy, and paste song lyrics for each of those Led Zeppelin songs, but hey, zep has over 100 songs! No way I'm that un-lazy. Let's automate it.\n\nLuckily, there is yet _another_ tool that can help us! Enter *figurative drum roll please...* 🥁🥁🥁 LyricWikia, written by enricobacis on GitHub: https://github.com/enricobacis/lyricwikia (I mean, c'mon, the example in the README is even Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven!)\n\nSo, we're basically done. We loop over our songs and write the retrieved lyrics to their own file. We are also going to write a 'global' lyrics file - simply all the lyrics strings concatenated together to a file called `input.txt` --> don't worry; I'm not crazy, this will be important later. Data retrieval code is done and looks like this:\n\n`get_lyrics.py`\n```python\nimport lyricwikia\n\nlSongNames = [\"10 Ribs & All/Carrot Pod Pod\",\n\"Achilles Last Stand\",\n\"All My Love\",\n\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\",\n\"Baby Come On Home\" ,\n\"Bathroom Sound\",\n\"The Battle of Evermore\",\n\"Black Country Woman\",\n\"Black Dog\",\n\"Black Mountain Side\",\n\"Blot\",\n\"Bonzo's Montreux\",\n\"Boogie with Stu\",\n\"Brandy & Coke\",\n\"Bring It On Home\",\n\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\",\n\"Bron-Yr-Aur\",\n\"Candy Store Rock\",\n\"Carouselambra\",\n\"Celebration Day\",\n\"Communication Breakdown\",\n\"The Crunge\",\n\"Custard Pie\",\n\"C'mon Everybody\",\n\"Dancing Days\",\n\"Darlene\",\n\"Dazed and Confused\",\n\"Desire\",\n\"Down by the Seaside\",\n\"Driving Through Kashmir\",\n\"D'yer Mak'er\",\n\"The Epic\",\n\"Everybody Makes It Through\",\n\"Fool in the Rain\",\n\"For Your Life\",\n\"Four Sticks\",\n\"Four Hands\",\n\"Friends\",\n\"Gallows Pole\",\n\"The Girl I Love She Got Long Black Wavy Hair\",\n\"Going to California\",\n\"Good Times Bad Times\",\n\"Hats Off to (Roy) Harper\",\n\"Heartbreaker\",\n\"Hey, Hey, What Can I Do\",\n\"The Hook\",\n\"Hot Dog\",\n\"Hots On for Nowhere\",\n\"Houses of the Holy\",\n\"How Many More Times\",\n\"I Can't Quit You Baby\",\n\"If It Keeps On Raining\",\n\"I'm Gonna Crawl\",\n\"Immigrant Song\",\n\"In My Time of Dying\",\n\"In the Evening\",\n\"In the Light\",\n\"Jennings Farm Blues\",\n\"Kashmir\",\n\"Key to the Highway/Trouble in Mind\",\n\"LA Drone\",\n\"La La\",\n\"The Lemon Song\",\n\"Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)\",\n\"Misty Mountain Hop\",\n\"Moby Dick\",\n\"Night Flight\",\n\"Nobody's Fault but Mine\",\n\"No Quarter\",\n\"The Ocean\",\n\"Out on the Tiles\",\n\"Over the Hills and Far Away\",\n\"Ozone Baby\",\n\"Poor Tom\",\n\"The Rain Song\",\n\"Ramble On\",\n\"Rock and Roll\",\n\"The Rover\",\n\"Royal Orleans\",\n\"Sick Again\",\n\"Since I've Been Loving You\",\n\"Somethin' Else\",\n\"The Song Remains the Same\",\n\"South Bound Saurez\",\n\"Southbound Piano\",\n\"St. Tristan's Sword\",\n\"Stairway to Heaven\",\n\"Sugar Mama\",\n\"Sunshine Woman\",\n\"Tangerine\",\n\"Tea for One\",\n\"Ten Years Gone\",\n\"Thank You\",\n\"That's the Way\",\n\"Trampled Under Foot\",\n\"Travelling Riverside Blues\",\n\"Two Ones Are Won\",\n\"Walter's Walk\",\n\"The Wanton Song\",\n\"Wearing and Tearing\",\n\"We're Gonna Groove\",\n\"What Is and What Should Never Be\",\n\"When the Levee Breaks\",\n\"White Summer/Black Mountain Side\",\n\"Whole Lotta Love\",\n\"You Shook Me\",\n\"Your Time Is Gonna Come\"]\n\nfor sSongName in lSongNames:\n    try:\n        sLyrics = lyricwikia.get_lyrics('Led Zeppelin', sSongName)\n    except:\n        print \"Lyrics not found for \" + sSongName\n    else:\n        sFileName = sSongName.replace(\"'\", \"\") # will cause weird file names\n        sFileName = \"-\".join(sFileName.split()) # dashes where each space is\n        with open(\"lyrics/\" + sFileName + \".txt\", \"w\") as f: \n            f.write(sLyrics)\n            f.close()\n            print \"Lyrics saved for \" + sSongName\n\n```\n\nThe songs that failed through the first pass were:\n\n```txt\n10 Ribs & All/Carrot Pod Pod\nBathroom Sound\nBlot\nBrandy & Coke\nDesire\nDriving Through Kashmir\nThe Epic\nFour Hands\nHey, Hey, What Can I Do\nThe Hook\nIf It Keeps On Raining\nJennings Farm Blues\nKey to the Highway/Trouble in Mind\nLA Drone\nLa La\nSouthbound Piano\nSt. Tristan's Sword\nTwo Ones Are Won\n```\n\nNot so bad- we've retrieved what is the vast majority of Led Zeppelin's lyrics in a matter of minutes. However, I'm still too lazy to get these lyrics by hand - I'm not gonna add 'em. 😂\n\n## Data Analysis - Word Occurrences\n\nSo we've retrieved our data. I wanted to count most common words as a simple start to analyze these lyrics. So, relying heavily on `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit) we build a corpus from all the lyrics, remove the stopwords, and count the occurrences with Python's `Counter` module. That is:\n\n`word_counts.py` \n```python\nimport os\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nfrom nltk.corpus.reader.plaintext import PlaintextCorpusReader\n\nstop_words = set(stopwords.words('english')) # not interested in stop words\nstop_words.update(['.', ',', \"',\", '\"', \"'\", '?', '!', ':', ';', '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', '}', '-']) # ... or punctuation\n\ncorpusdir = 'lyrics/' # Directory of corpus.\noLedZeppelinCorpus = PlaintextCorpusReader(corpusdir, '.*')\n\nlNoStopWords = []\nfor sWord in oLedZeppelinCorpus.words():\n    if sWord not in stop_words:\n        lNoStopWords.append(sWord)\n\nlNoStopWordsLength = len(lNoStopWords)\nwordCounts = Counter(lNoStopWords)\nwordCountsLower = Counter(i.lower() for i in lNoStopWords)\n\n# top 25\nlCountLabels, lCountValues = zip(*wordCountsLower.most_common(50)[0:25])\nlCountIndexes = np.arange(len(lCountLabels))\niCountWidth = 1\nbarlist = plt.bar(lCountIndexes, lCountValues)\nfor i in range(0, len(barlist)): # all bars to black\n    barlist[i].set_color('black')\nplt.xticks(lCountIndexes, lCountLabels)\nplt.title(\"Word Occurrences in Led Zeppelin Lyrics\")\nplt.ylabel('Number of Occurrences Across All Songs')\nplt.xlabel('Lyric')\nplt.show()\n\n# next 25\nlCountLabels, lCountValues = zip(*wordCountsLower.most_common(50)[25:50])\nlCountIndexes = np.arange(len(lCountLabels))\niCountWidth = 1\nbarlist = plt.bar(lCountIndexes, lCountValues)\nfor i in range(0, len(barlist)): # all bars to black\n    barlist[i].set_color('black')\nplt.xticks(lCountIndexes, lCountLabels)\nplt.title(\"Word Occurrences in Led Zeppelin Lyrics\")\nplt.ylabel('Number of Occurrences Across All Songs')\nplt.xlabel('Lyric')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThe first plot, of the top 25 most common words, looks like this:\n\n![First 25 most common words](most_common.png)\n\nIn a way, I think we've found the 'stop words' of Led Zeppelin. 😂 I could have almost expected 'babe' and 'baby' - it's repeated so many times in so many of their songs. However, if we go a bit further down in the most common words, namely to the next set of 25 most common words, we see a bit more 'meat' of the lyrics:\n\n![25-50 most common words](most_common_lower.png)\n\nwhat I think is really neat here, almost zen-like, is that the group has managed to use the words 'night' and 'day' exactly the same number of times - 100.\n\n## Data Analysis - Markov Chains\n\nOnce again I revisited Markov Chains - what's better than to get some inspiration from poorly written robot lyrics? Since I've only worked with Markov Chains in Nodejs before, I had to look around for a . I ended up borrowing a lot from this very basic implementation from Toward's Data Science's Medium channel: https://towardsdatascience.com/simulating-text-with-markov-chains-in-python-1a27e6d13fc6\n \n> \\- ma - ooh , in my heart You know the , didn ' t take it told me go If it ' t have to know where you there where the downhill slide Oh , make ya know , now I couldn ' ve decided what the wind won '\n \n> ' d do , honey As we sweep with death The Queen of the storm who really good friend They give to care if you now , They say \" Take him by takin ' m - la ) Spend it has !

But inspiring a bit? At least? Maybe.<sup>Maybe.</sup>\n\n## Data Analysis - More Advanced - Word Level Recurring Neural Network (RNN)\n\nTurn on the 💻CPU fan - we're going Tensorflow. 😂\n\nWe're going to use a nice Word level RNN for starters, from hunkim on GitHub: [https://github.com/hunkim/word-rnn-tensorflow](https://github.com/hunkim/word-rnn-tensorflow)\n\nFor your convenience, I forked a version (basically with the Led Zeppelin corpus in the `data/` folder and changing the hardcoded file names in `train.py`) That's here: https://github.com/frewinchristopher/word-rnn-tensorflow-led-zeppelin\n\nThese look _much_ better than the wacky Markov chains:\n\n> tonight quarter) 'The Little proud thunder We've follow A-poor Daw upon lonely, lovin', can't Do me oughta could all, join clothes (Ah~ah-hah-hah-hah) low Baby, come on, could been Gonna was back in the best be a hurts Now, oh baby, never, talkin' Do some way. woman In the We've are 'round a in-a please, is is, Beneath me light! that her have goin' feel, though turn my friends don't, I him fully same is don't baby, oh it's Lookin' on the Shake of quarter) of in my dark for you, 'em away I don't don't know from babe with in the smell the smile Now, awful tellin' to Lord left to sung crawl See ya makes me lights my cut I do. truck Oh, know no? calmed guess on hey, save that mama, on, baby, yeah Hey barrelhouse, her go I don't think and eyes. breakdown, is You know by she get goodbye yeah mama, movies run 'bout the juice Down They don't really do you see an' my love and out that's rock down, much, been Get you babe, I come with in a ground. times, a door Let me 'Cause it feel, babe, the heathen snow drives that me\n\n> sand lifetime do, fire more, begin? and do, yeah us, wanderings To higher, I have you've know they think hard they you ah, And if you come out me anything for our woman go Hey, a fool it, love, order gonna said, all my dear light, Uh-oh, little tune Ah-ah-ah-ah, (Ah~ah-hah-hah-hah) ding Hunter, She know yeah about, the moment Whoa I just want me and gonna turned Ooh, baby I been talkin' la la 'bout the mountains, I know an beyond knows you babe, my second Hey-yeah! yeah... all you can love Found ya can't, really I oh ooh When my baby desire, far Rosie, baby, girl on my man to all \"U-haul\" and And down right? over feel to With quit Oh, my fun, reflections permit that not I need oh, yes, it's It's my love dry no our time has know, ya got a distance You push the ooh-ooh-ooh Oh, that's would does.

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\n\\*\\*\\*Note: this post is mirrored on NLP Champs: [https://nlp-champs.com/led-zeppelin-data-analysis-for-lyric-generation-and-inspiration](https://nlp-champs.com/led-zeppelin-data-analysis-for-lyric-generation-and-inspiration)\n\n## Inspiration and Motivation\n\nI've been recently inspired by Greta Van Fleet, basically the latest band since the Black Keys that can truly rock. This naturally has gotten me listening to Led Zeppelin again as well, and I've even been getting back to writing a few classic rock style tunes with my acoustic guitar. This was a neat little project I threw together in order to try to generate some new lyrics, and also to see what could make those Led Zeppelin / Greta Van Fleet lyrics just so... _zepplin-ey_ :smile:\n\n## Important: I'm Lazy.\n\nYep, if anyone out there has been following along in my blogging adventures, you'll know that I'm lazy. Anything that can be automated, I'm going to try to automate it! (Or in the very least, partially automate it or find a tool to use to make my life easier.) Actually, the entire concept of this post reflects my laziness: I'm willing to make a tool that generates lyrics _for_ me before I visit my buddy this summer as we prepare to write an EP together! (Yikes! - I'll let you know how _that_ goes!)\n\n## Getting the List of Song Names\n\nThere's this neat tool that I found that extracts lists from Wikipedia pages: http://wikitable2csv.ggor.de/, built by Gregor Weichbrodt. Nice one, Gregor! And... (yes you can see where this is going) of course, Wikipedia has a list for everything <sup>TM</sup> (no, that is not actually trademarked) And guess what? They have a \"List of songs recorded by Led Zeppelin\" page! [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_songs\\_recorded\\_by\\_Led\\_Zeppelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_recorded_by_Led_Zeppelin)\n\nThrow that into Gregor's tool, and you've got your .csv data, which with 5 seconds work with Sublime text, becomes our song list:\n\n```python\nlSongNames = [\"10 Ribs & All/Carrot Pod Pod\",\n\"Achilles Last Stand\",\n\"All My Love\",\n\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\",\n\"Baby Come On Home\" ,\n\"Bathroom Sound\",\n\"The Battle of Evermore\",\n\"Black Country Woman\",\n\"Black Dog\",\n\"Black Mountain Side\",\n\"Blot\",\n\"Bonzo's Montreux\",\n\"Boogie with Stu\",\n\"Brandy & Coke\",\n\"Bring It On Home\",\n\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\",\n\"Bron-Yr-Aur\",\n\"Candy Store Rock\",\n\"Carouselambra\",\n\"Celebration Day\",\n\"Communication Breakdown\",\n\"The Crunge\",\n\"Custard Pie\",\n\"C'mon Everybody\",\n\"Dancing Days\",\n\"Darlene\",\n\"Dazed and Confused\",\n\"Desire\",\n\"Down by the Seaside\",\n\"Driving Through Kashmir\",\n\"D'yer Mak'er\",\n\"The Epic\",\n\"Everybody Makes It Through\",\n\"Fool in the Rain\",\n\"For Your Life\",\n\"Four Sticks\",\n\"Four Hands\",\n\"Friends\",\n\"Gallows Pole\",\n\"The Girl I Love She Got Long Black Wavy Hair\",\n\"Going to California\",\n\"Good Times Bad Times\",\n\"Hats Off to (Roy) Harper\",\n\"Heartbreaker\",\n\"Hey, Hey, What Can I Do\",\n\"The Hook\",\n\"Hot Dog\",\n\"Hots On for Nowhere\",\n\"Houses of the Holy\",\n\"How Many More Times\",\n\"I Can't Quit You Baby\",\n\"If It Keeps On Raining\",\n\"I'm Gonna Crawl\",\n\"Immigrant Song\",\n\"In My Time of Dying\",\n\"In the Evening\",\n\"In the Light\",\n\"Jennings Farm Blues\",\n\"Kashmir\",\n\"Key to the Highway/Trouble in Mind\",\n\"LA Drone\",\n\"La La\",\n\"The Lemon Song\",\n\"Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)\",\n\"Misty Mountain Hop\",\n\"Moby Dick\",\n\"Night Flight\",\n\"Nobody's Fault but Mine\",\n\"No Quarter\",\n\"The Ocean\",\n\"Out on the Tiles\",\n\"Over the Hills and Far Away\",\n\"Ozone Baby\",\n\"Poor Tom\",\n\"The Rain Song\",\n\"Ramble On\",\n\"Rock and Roll\",\n\"The Rover\",\n\"Royal Orleans\",\n\"Sick Again\",\n\"Since I've Been Loving You\",\n\"Somethin' Else\",\n\"The Song Remains the Same\",\n\"South Bound Saurez\",\n\"Southbound Piano\",\n\"St. Tristan's Sword\",\n\"Stairway to Heaven\",\n\"Sugar Mama\",\n\"Sunshine Woman\",\n\"Tangerine\",\n\"Tea for One\",\n\"Ten Years Gone\",\n\"Thank You\",\n\"That's the Way\",\n\"Trampled Under Foot\",\n\"Travelling Riverside Blues\",\n\"Two Ones Are Won\",\n\"Walter's Walk\",\n\"The Wanton Song\",\n\"Wearing and Tearing\",\n\"We're Gonna Groove\",\n\"What Is and What Should Never Be\",\n\"When the Levee Breaks\",\n\"White Summer/Black Mountain Side\",\n\"Whole Lotta Love\",\n\"You Shook Me\",\n\"Your Time Is Gonna Come\"]\n```\n\n## Getting Lyrics for Each Song\n\nSo great, we've got our list of songs in Python syntax. We need the actual _lyrics_ now. And yes, I'm going to continue this post's laziness theme! I could go to Google, copy, and paste song lyrics for each of those Led Zeppelin songs, but hey, zep has over 100 songs! No way I'm that un-lazy. Let's automate it.\n\nLuckily, there is yet _another_ tool that can help us! Enter *figurative drum roll please...* :drum::drum::drum: LyricWikia, written by enricobacis on GitHub: https://github.com/enricobacis/lyricwikia (I mean, c'mon, the example in the README is even Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven!)\n\nSo, we're basically done. We loop over our songs and write the retrieved lyrics to their own file. We are also going to write a 'global' lyrics file - simply all the lyrics strings concatenated together to a file called `input.txt` --> don't worry; I'm not crazy, this will be important later. Data retrieval code is done and looks like this:\n\n`get_lyrics.py`\n```python\nimport lyricwikia\n\nlSongNames = [\"10 Ribs & All/Carrot Pod Pod\",\n\"Achilles Last Stand\",\n\"All My Love\",\n\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\",\n\"Baby Come On Home\" ,\n\"Bathroom Sound\",\n\"The Battle of Evermore\",\n\"Black Country Woman\",\n\"Black Dog\",\n\"Black Mountain Side\",\n\"Blot\",\n\"Bonzo's Montreux\",\n\"Boogie with Stu\",\n\"Brandy & Coke\",\n\"Bring It On Home\",\n\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\",\n\"Bron-Yr-Aur\",\n\"Candy Store Rock\",\n\"Carouselambra\",\n\"Celebration Day\",\n\"Communication Breakdown\",\n\"The Crunge\",\n\"Custard Pie\",\n\"C'mon Everybody\",\n\"Dancing Days\",\n\"Darlene\",\n\"Dazed and Confused\",\n\"Desire\",\n\"Down by the Seaside\",\n\"Driving Through Kashmir\",\n\"D'yer Mak'er\",\n\"The Epic\",\n\"Everybody Makes It Through\",\n\"Fool in the Rain\",\n\"For Your Life\",\n\"Four Sticks\",\n\"Four Hands\",\n\"Friends\",\n\"Gallows Pole\",\n\"The Girl I Love She Got Long Black Wavy Hair\",\n\"Going to California\",\n\"Good Times Bad Times\",\n\"Hats Off to (Roy) Harper\",\n\"Heartbreaker\",\n\"Hey, Hey, What Can I Do\",\n\"The Hook\",\n\"Hot Dog\",\n\"Hots On for Nowhere\",\n\"Houses of the Holy\",\n\"How Many More Times\",\n\"I Can't Quit You Baby\",\n\"If It Keeps On Raining\",\n\"I'm Gonna Crawl\",\n\"Immigrant Song\",\n\"In My Time of Dying\",\n\"In the Evening\",\n\"In the Light\",\n\"Jennings Farm Blues\",\n\"Kashmir\",\n\"Key to the Highway/Trouble in Mind\",\n\"LA Drone\",\n\"La La\",\n\"The Lemon Song\",\n\"Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)\",\n\"Misty Mountain Hop\",\n\"Moby Dick\",\n\"Night Flight\",\n\"Nobody's Fault but Mine\",\n\"No Quarter\",\n\"The Ocean\",\n\"Out on the Tiles\",\n\"Over the Hills and Far Away\",\n\"Ozone Baby\",\n\"Poor Tom\",\n\"The Rain Song\",\n\"Ramble On\",\n\"Rock and Roll\",\n\"The Rover\",\n\"Royal Orleans\",\n\"Sick Again\",\n\"Since I've Been Loving You\",\n\"Somethin' Else\",\n\"The Song Remains the Same\",\n\"South Bound Saurez\",\n\"Southbound Piano\",\n\"St. Tristan's Sword\",\n\"Stairway to Heaven\",\n\"Sugar Mama\",\n\"Sunshine Woman\",\n\"Tangerine\",\n\"Tea for One\",\n\"Ten Years Gone\",\n\"Thank You\",\n\"That's the Way\",\n\"Trampled Under Foot\",\n\"Travelling Riverside Blues\",\n\"Two Ones Are Won\",\n\"Walter's Walk\",\n\"The Wanton Song\",\n\"Wearing and Tearing\",\n\"We're Gonna Groove\",\n\"What Is and What Should Never Be\",\n\"When the Levee Breaks\",\n\"White Summer/Black Mountain Side\",\n\"Whole Lotta Love\",\n\"You Shook Me\",\n\"Your Time Is Gonna Come\"]\n\nfor sSongName in lSongNames:\n    try:\n        sLyrics = lyricwikia.get_lyrics('Led Zeppelin', sSongName)\n    except:\n        print \"Lyrics not found for \" + sSongName\n    else:\n        sFileName = sSongName.replace(\"'\", \"\") # will cause weird file names\n        sFileName = \"-\".join(sFileName.split()) # dashes where each space is\n        with open(\"lyrics/\" + sFileName + \".txt\", \"w\") as f: \n            f.write(sLyrics)\n            f.close()\n            print \"Lyrics saved for \" + sSongName\n\n```\n\nThe songs that failed through the first pass were:\n\n```txt\n10 Ribs & All/Carrot Pod Pod\nBathroom Sound\nBlot\nBrandy & Coke\nDesire\nDriving Through Kashmir\nThe Epic\nFour Hands\nHey, Hey, What Can I Do\nThe Hook\nIf It Keeps On Raining\nJennings Farm Blues\nKey to the Highway/Trouble in Mind\nLA Drone\nLa La\nSouthbound Piano\nSt. Tristan's Sword\nTwo Ones Are Won\n```\n\nNot so bad- we've retrieved what is the vast majority of Led Zeppelin's lyrics in a matter of minutes. However, I'm still too lazy to get these lyrics by hand - I'm not gonna add 'em. :joy:\n\n## Data Analysis - Word Occurrences\n\nSo we've retrieved our data. I wanted to count most common words as a simple start to analyze these lyrics. So, relying heavily on `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit) we build a corpus from all the lyrics, remove the stopwords, and count the occurrences with Python's `Counter` module. That is:\n\n`word_counts.py` \n```python\nimport os\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nfrom nltk.corpus.reader.plaintext import PlaintextCorpusReader\n\nstop_words = set(stopwords.words('english')) # not interested in stop words\nstop_words.update(['.', ',', \"',\", '\"', \"'\", '?', '!', ':', ';', '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', '}', '-']) # ... or punctuation\n\ncorpusdir = 'lyrics/' # Directory of corpus.\noLedZeppelinCorpus = PlaintextCorpusReader(corpusdir, '.*')\n\nlNoStopWords = []\nfor sWord in oLedZeppelinCorpus.words():\n    if sWord not in stop_words:\n        lNoStopWords.append(sWord)\n\nlNoStopWordsLength = len(lNoStopWords)\nwordCounts = Counter(lNoStopWords)\nwordCountsLower = Counter(i.lower() for i in lNoStopWords)\n\n# top 25\nlCountLabels, lCountValues = zip(*wordCountsLower.most_common(50)[0:25])\nlCountIndexes = np.arange(len(lCountLabels))\niCountWidth = 1\nbarlist = plt.bar(lCountIndexes, lCountValues)\nfor i in range(0, len(barlist)): # all bars to black\n    barlist[i].set_color('black')\nplt.xticks(lCountIndexes, lCountLabels)\nplt.title(\"Word Occurrences in Led Zeppelin Lyrics\")\nplt.ylabel('Number of Occurrences Across All Songs')\nplt.xlabel('Lyric')\nplt.show()\n\n# next 25\nlCountLabels, lCountValues = zip(*wordCountsLower.most_common(50)[25:50])\nlCountIndexes = np.arange(len(lCountLabels))\niCountWidth = 1\nbarlist = plt.bar(lCountIndexes, lCountValues)\nfor i in range(0, len(barlist)): # all bars to black\n    barlist[i].set_color('black')\nplt.xticks(lCountIndexes, lCountLabels)\nplt.title(\"Word Occurrences in Led Zeppelin Lyrics\")\nplt.ylabel('Number of Occurrences Across All Songs')\nplt.xlabel('Lyric')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThe first plot, of the top 25 most common words, looks like this:\n\n![First 25 most common words](most_common.png)\n\nIn a way, I think we've found the 'stop words' of Led Zeppelin. :joy: I could have almost expected 'babe' and 'baby' - it's repeated so many times in so many of their songs. However, if we go a bit further down in the most common words, namely to the next set of 25 most common words, we see a bit more 'meat' of the lyrics:\n\n![25-50 most common words](most_common_lower.png)\n\nwhat I think is really neat here, almost zen-like, is that the group has managed to use the words 'night' and 'day' exactly the same number of times - 100.\n\n## Data Analysis - Markov Chains\n\nOnce again I revisited Markov Chains - what's better than to get some inspiration from poorly written robot lyrics? Since I've only worked with Markov Chains in Nodejs before, I had to look around for a . I ended up borrowing a lot from this very basic implementation from Toward's Data Science's Medium channel: https://towardsdatascience.com/simulating-text-with-markov-chains-in-python-1a27e6d13fc6\n \n> \\- ma - ooh , in my heart You know the , didn ' t take it told me go If it ' t have to know where you there where the downhill slide Oh , make ya know , now I couldn ' ve decided what the wind won '\n \n> ' d do , honey As we sweep with death The Queen of the storm who really good friend They give to care if you now , They say \" Take him by takin ' m - la ) Spend it has !

But inspiring a bit? At least? Maybe.<sup>Maybe.</sup>\n\n## Data Analysis - More Advanced - Word Level Recurring Neural Network (RNN)\n\nTurn on the :computer:CPU fan - we're going Tensorflow. :joy:\n\nWe're going to use a nice Word level RNN for starters, from hunkim on GitHub: [https://github.com/hunkim/word-rnn-tensorflow](https://github.com/hunkim/word-rnn-tensorflow)\n\nFor your convenience, I forked a version (basically with the Led Zeppelin corpus in the `data/` folder and changing the hardcoded file names in `train.py`) That's here: https://github.com/frewinchristopher/word-rnn-tensorflow-led-zeppelin\n\nThese look _much_ better than the wacky Markov chains:\n\n> tonight quarter) 'The Little proud thunder We've follow A-poor Daw upon lonely, lovin', can't Do me oughta could all, join clothes (Ah~ah-hah-hah-hah) low Baby, come on, could been Gonna was back in the best be a hurts Now, oh baby, never, talkin' Do some way. woman In the We've are 'round a in-a please, is is, Beneath me light! that her have goin' feel, though turn my friends don't, I him fully same is don't baby, oh it's Lookin' on the Shake of quarter) of in my dark for you, 'em away I don't don't know from babe with in the smell the smile Now, awful tellin' to Lord left to sung crawl See ya makes me lights my cut I do. truck Oh, know no? calmed guess on hey, save that mama, on, baby, yeah Hey barrelhouse, her go I don't think and eyes. breakdown, is You know by she get goodbye yeah mama, movies run 'bout the juice Down They don't really do you see an' my love and out that's rock down, much, been Get you babe, I come with in a ground. times, a door Let me 'Cause it feel, babe, the heathen snow drives that me\n\n> sand lifetime do, fire more, begin? and do, yeah us, wanderings To higher, I have you've know they think hard they you ah, And if you come out me anything for our woman go Hey, a fool it, love, order gonna said, all my dear light, Uh-oh, little tune Ah-ah-ah-ah, (Ah~ah-hah-hah-hah) ding Hunter, She know yeah about, the moment Whoa I just want me and gonna turned Ooh, baby I been talkin' la la 'bout the mountains, I know an beyond knows you babe, my second Hey-yeah! yeah... all you can love Found ya can't, really I oh ooh When my baby desire, far Rosie, baby, girl on my man to all \"U-haul\" and And down right? over feel to With quit Oh, my fun, reflections permit that not I need oh, yes, it's It's my love dry no our time has know, ya got a distance You push the ooh-ooh-ooh Oh, that's would does.

        "content": "\nI've been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I've seen thrown around our very own interwebs. \n\nMind you, they aren't directly depressing to _me_, but rather, they're making me depressed on behalf of other people, because I think people throwing numbers around don't really know what they're getting into. \n\nLet me explain what I mean. \n\n## Ridiculous Retirement Savings Targets\n\nAll over chat boards (reddit included), I see target \"early\" retirement / financial independent net worth figures of _at least_ $1,000,000, many 2.5 million _or higher_. Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let's dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.\n\nLet's say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html). \n\nIf you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement. \n\nAt this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don't forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you're right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it's only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million... -\\_-\n\nYeah. Let's let that sink in for a while... \n\nStill wanna get to $1,000,000 before \"pulling the trigger\"? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as the white and black 'working' and 'not working' buckets - it's never like that anyway).\n\nI think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven't run the numbers themselves. \n\nListen, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let's raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.\n\nEven at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths usually filled with lucky opportunities, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I'm sorry, I think that's a bunch of snake oil. In short:\n\n**Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of $1,000,000 or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement plans.**\n\nI see many people proudly touting the fact they are maxing out their 401Ks ($18,500 max as of 2018) and their Roth IRAs (a meager $5,500 max) - a total of $24,000 per year. This follows a similar outlook as examples above: 25 years to $1,000,000 and a staggering 41 years for 2.5 million when compounded yearly at 4%.  So, if you are one of these 'touters' and think you are on some miraculous road to financial independence and returns will somehow fall out of the ether, YOUR ARE WRONG! If you want a true fast pass to an early financial independence, you'd better think (you'd need to do this anyway since the 401k and Roth withdrawal is at 59.5 years of age - otherwise you're gonna take the tax hit.) \n\nThese are not lies, this is not my own smoke and mirrors show. This is pure math of constant yearly contribution with 4% year-over-year returns from this super basic calculator: http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\n\nIf you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 60-80 years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won't even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but I've laid out the numbers as plan as I could.\n\n## Get Real With a More Realistic Target\n\nTherefore, I follow in the footsteps of wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still surprisingly very powerful) new target net worth amount for when you can \"quit your job\" (again, more on that soon) and call yourself retired / financial independent:\n\n**$600,000.00**\n\nI hear the internet laughing: \"600K?!\" You all chuckle, \"Why, that's just only over _half_ of a big ol' million!\" Well excuse me, but with 600K you can:\n\n- Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that's already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S's per year?)\n- Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)\nOr, if you live like me (which is why it is my \"financial independence\" target)\n- **Live for 25 years on a 24K a year budget.**\n\nLet's stop and think about that. 25 years on a 24k budget. It will take me anyway another 11 years to get to $600,000 I'll be 37 then. That means, if I don't do a damn thing for 25 years, my savings will completely run out when I'm 62. But I haven't included a key variable: _time_. This 25 year figure doesn't include the face that over those 25 years, the money I _don't_ take out of my index funds is _still gaining value at 4%, year over year_. Let's take a moment and include that fact, and this is where the hidden power of non-million sized numbers and market comes to light:\n\n```\nYear 1 of FIRE: start with $600000 and take out $24000 (assume on january 1st)\n$576000 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$575040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$23002 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$551002 @ 4% for 1 year (~$22040 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$526040 @ 4% for 1 year (~$21042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$501042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$20042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$476042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$19042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$451042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$18042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$426042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$17042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$401042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$16042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$376042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$15042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$351042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$14042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$326042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$13042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$301042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$12042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$276042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$11042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$251042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$10042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$226042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$9042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$201042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$8042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$176042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$7042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$151042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$6042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$126042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$5042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$101042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$4042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$76042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$3042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$51042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$2042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year)\n$26042 @ 4% for 1 year (~$1042 in market gains this year, add to principle for next year) \n```\n\nJust within the first 5 years of drawing from our index funds, we squeeze out ~$109166 worth of 'extra' of market gains, simply because we didn't draw those funds out during the large majority of time in that 24 year window... indeed, this value of extra per-year market gains really tapers off over the last 10ish years of withdrawal (especially with any years of market downturns), but see the pattern here?!?\n\nDoes anyone realize, when you \"retire\" you don't cash your whole damn index fund to cash!? You're gonna miss out on 25 years of market growth!!\n\nBecause you're only cashing out 25K per year. **Living frugally is key here.**\n\n## What it Should Truly Mean to Be Financially Independent\n\nLet me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check.\n\nBecause, let's be honest, if you can't find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in 25 years, you've got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.\n\n## A Weird  Actuary's View of Getting to 700K\n\nFor the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets bump up my 600K target to a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.\nLets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:\n\n```\n1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)\n7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)\n70 people to give me $10000 (eh...)\n700 people to give me $1000 (with a _very_ nice product/service I could see this partially happening)\n7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we're getting there)\n70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)\n700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)\n```\n\nLet's consider returning customers:\n\n```\n35 people to give me $10000 twice \n350 people to give me $1000 twice \n3500 people to give me $100 twice \n35,000 people to give me $10 twice \n350,000 people to give me $1 twice \n```\n\nSuper awesome returning customers with a very nice brand/product/service:\n\n```\n14 people to give me $10000 five times \n140 people to give me $1000 five times \n1400 people to give me $100 five times \n14000 people to give me $10 five times \n140,000 people to give me $1 five times \n```\n\nYes, these numbers are _way_ to simple to just apply to such a massive amount of money as $700,000... but it does get you thinking...\n\n## My Call to Anyone Who is Listening\n\nSo that was my own personal version of what is known otherwise as 'lean' FIRE. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach $1,000,000 (and you probably know who you are), don't try and shoot for these crazy targets - I don't think it leads to happiness, and it certainly won't lead to any innovation or great works.\n\nSo my final call to anyone out there who will listen is this: build your 600K foundation, then move to follow your true passions - even better when that passion can generate more income, and I think you'll find it does when you spend years building something. \n\nRemember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years cushion to ride out on and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art, stop global warming, save the world, I don't care! Whatever you do, don't sit in an office doing something you hate just because you are _scared_. Remember, you won't need ANY income for 2.5 decades. The only question remains is:\n\nWhat will you build?\n\n-Chris\n\n",

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\nI've been generating ideas for this post for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I've seen thrown around our very own interwebs. \n\nMind you, they aren't directly depressing to _me_, but rather, they're making me depressed on behalf of other people, because I think people throwing numbers around don't really know what they're getting into. \n\nLet me explain what I mean. \n\n## Ridiculous Retirement Savings Targets\n\nAll over chat boards (reddit included), I see target \"early\" retirement / financial independent net worth figures of _at least_ $1,000,000, many 2.5 million _or higher_. Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let's dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that would require.\n\nLet's say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html). \n\nIf you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year: https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement. \n\nAt this rate, you would need 282 years to reach $1,000,000 (6% of $59,000 is $3,540, which goes into $1,000,000 about 282 times), and a vast 520 years to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, don't forget my average 4% yearly return on investment. Ok, you're right, let me incorporate that into the calculation: it's only a balmy 64 years to get to $1,000,000 and a quick 86 years to get to 2.5 million... -\\_-\n\nYeah. Let's let that sink in for a while... \n\nStill wanna get to $1,000,000 before \"pulling the trigger\"? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way - why has society defined life as the white and black 'working' and 'not working' buckets - it's never like that anyway).\n\nI think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven't run the numbers themselves. \n\nListen, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let's raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. With only a 6% savings rate (that means investing $15,000 a year), you still need 33 years to reach that heralded $1,000,000 target.\n\nEven at my own personal cheapo-ass-self savings rate of about 60% per year (investing about $40,000 per year), I still need 18 years to reach $1,000,000, and a whopping 31 to reach 2.5 million.

this adds any of the changes you made in your bash profile - any new commands and whatnot - into the current terminal):\n\n```bash\nalias prof='atom /Users/chris/.bash_profile' # opens .bash_profile for editing\nalias s='source /Users/chris/.bash_profile' # sources .bash_profile (should be done every time after changing profile)\n```\n\nSo yes, you could say I modify and add stuff to my bash profile quite often - I recommend you do it too! Improve your workflow and ease of commanding a bash terminal!\n\n-Cheers! 🍺\n\nChris\n",

this adds any of the changes you made in your bash profile - any new commands and whatnot - into the current terminal):\n\n```bash\nalias prof='atom /Users/chris/.bash_profile' # opens .bash_profile for editing\nalias s='source /Users/chris/.bash_profile' # sources .bash_profile (should be done every time after changing profile)\n```\n\nSo yes, you could say I modify and add stuff to my bash profile quite often - I recommend you do it too! Improve your workflow and ease of commanding a bash terminal!\n\n-Cheers! :beer:\n\nChris\n",

We were able to verify if the service wasn't working properly by pinging an RFC node. If the RFC ping returned with an error, then we knew the service was not working - don't worry, this RFC ping will come into the code later.\n\nOne lazy Friday when I didn't have much to do, I was brainstorming if it was possible that maybe I could take this ticket into my own hands, writing something on our ABAP stack that could do the trick.\n\n# The Problem\n\nI knew at least that I had to issue specific commands to the command line. That much I already knew how to do - I had used custom command services in SAP/ABAP with transaction SM69 before. The hard thing that I got stuck with: how could I, from our SAP application server, issue a specific command, to the Service Control Manager, to a specific service? Whew. Still with me? With help from one of our basic team members, we discovered that as it turns out, Windows has a very nice command for exactly that.\n\nIt's called `sc`:\n\n```\nC:\\>sc\nDESCRIPTION:\n        SC is a command line program used for communicating with the\n        Service Control Manager and services.\nUSAGE:\n        sc <server> [command] [service name] <option1> <option2>...\n\n\n        The option <server> has the form \"\\\\ServerName\"\n        Further help on commands can be obtained by typing: \"sc [command]\"\n        Commands:\n          query-----------Queries the status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          queryex---------Queries the extended status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          start-----------Starts a service.\n          pause-----------Sends a PAUSE control request to a service.\n          interrogate-----Sends an INTERROGATE control request to a service.\n          continue--------Sends a CONTINUE control request to a service.\n          stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.\n          config----------Changes the configuration of a service (persistent).\n          description-----Changes the description of a service.\n          failure---------Changes the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          failureflag-----Changes the failure actions flag of a service.\n          sidtype---------Changes the service SID type of a service.\n          privs-----------Changes the required privileges of a service.\n          managedaccount--Changes the service to mark the service account password as managed by LSA.\n          qc--------------Queries the configuration information for a service.\n          qdescription----Queries the description for a service.\n          qfailure--------Queries the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          qfailureflag----Queries the failure actions flag of a service.\n          qsidtype--------Queries the service SID type of a service.\n          qprivs----------Queries the required privileges of a service.\n          qtriggerinfo----Queries the trigger parameters of a service.\n          qpreferrednode--Queries the preferred NUMA node of a service.\n          qrunlevel-------Queries the run level of a service.\n          qmanagedaccount-Queries whether a services uses an account with a password managed by LSA.\n          qprotection-----Queries the process protection level of a service.\n          delete----------Deletes a service (from the registry).\n          create----------Creates a service.

[ y | n ]:\n```\n\nWow. That's a monster of a command documentation. Let's break down what we need.\n\n- The server name. We know that (for this example, I'm going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There's a gotchya, we will need to write it like:\n\n`\\\\AWESOMESERVER01`\n\nThat's not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that's part of the `sc` command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:\n\n> > The option <server> has the form \"\\\\\\\\ServerName\"\n\nOkay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I'm going to call our service `ServiceName even with Whitespace`.\n\nOkay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let's check out that wall of text documentation:\n\n> > stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.\n\nYep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:\n\n> > Commands:\n  . . .\n  start-----------Starts a service.\n\nThat will be useful later, too.\n\nAlright... Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:\n\n`sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"`\n\nIn order for this to be a true _restart_ of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:\n\n`sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"`  \n`sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"`\n\nHow do we do that in ABAP? Well, to run SM69 commands programmatically, we have the tasty function module `SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE`:\n\n```abap\nCALL FUNCTION 'SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE'\n  EXPORTING\n    commandname                   = gv_commandname\n    additional_parameters         = gv_additional_parameters\n    operatingsystem               = gv_operatingsystem\n  TABLES\n    exec_protocol                 = gt_result\n  EXCEPTIONS\n    no_permission                 = 1\n    command_not_found             = 2\n    parameters_too_long           = 3\n    security_risk                 = 4\n    wrong_check_call_interface    = 5\n    program_start_error           = 6\n    program_termination_error     = 7\n    x_error                       = 8\n    parameter_expected            = 9\n    too_many_parameters           = 10\n    illegal_command               = 11\n    wrong_asynchronous_parameters = 12\n    cant_enq_tbtco_entry          = 13\n    jobcount_generation_error     = 14\n    OTHERS                        = 15.\n```\n\nI'll just say I maintained the two commands in SM69 as `Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_START` and `Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_STOP`.\n\nSo, all that's left is to check if the service is not responding. As I summarized above, if the Windows service was broken, the RFC node that talked to it would also be broken. (i.e. pinging it would not work). An RFC node is easy enough to test with function module `RFC_PING`.\n\n```abap\nCALL FUNCTION 'RFC_PING'\n  DESTINATION 'Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION'\n  EXCEPTIONS\n    system_failure        = 1\n    communication_failure = 2.\n```\n\nEasy enough. If `sy-subrc` is of value 1 or 2, then it means indeed, that our `Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION` is indeed broken.\n\nSo if it turns out this service is not responding, we call the command pair with function module `SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE`, check `sy-subrc`, and we are done!

      "rawMarkdownBody": "\nAlright, let's do a bit of applied stuff today.\n\n# Backstory\n\nFor a long time, I had a ticket open for our IT team (I am likewise in the SAP team) for an automatic job that would restart a certain task on a Windows server we had - for reasons we still don't know yet, this particular service would state that it was running, when in fact the job it was supposed to be orchestrating was clearly not running. We were able to verify if the service wasn't working properly by pinging an RFC node. If the RFC ping returned with an error, then we knew the service was not working - don't worry, this RFC ping will come into the code later.\n\nOne lazy Friday when I didn't have much to do, I was brainstorming if it was possible that maybe I could take this ticket into my own hands, writing something on our ABAP stack that could do the trick.\n\n# The Problem\n\nI knew at least that I had to issue specific commands to the command line. That much I already knew how to do - I had used custom command services in SAP/ABAP with transaction SM69 before. The hard thing that I got stuck with: how could I, from our SAP application server, issue a specific command, to the Service Control Manager, to a specific service? Whew. Still with me? With help from one of our basic team members, we discovered that as it turns out, Windows has a very nice command for exactly that.\n\nIt's called `sc`:\n\n```\nC:\\>sc\nDESCRIPTION:\n        SC is a command line program used for communicating with the\n        Service Control Manager and services.\nUSAGE:\n        sc <server> [command] [service name] <option1> <option2>...\n\n\n        The option <server> has the form \"\\\\ServerName\"\n        Further help on commands can be obtained by typing: \"sc [command]\"\n        Commands:\n          query-----------Queries the status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          queryex---------Queries the extended status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          start-----------Starts a service.\n          pause-----------Sends a PAUSE control request to a service.\n          interrogate-----Sends an INTERROGATE control request to a service.\n          continue--------Sends a CONTINUE control request to a service.\n          stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.\n          config----------Changes the configuration of a service (persistent).\n          description-----Changes the description of a service.\n          failure---------Changes the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          failureflag-----Changes the failure actions flag of a service.\n          sidtype---------Changes the service SID type of a service.\n          privs-----------Changes the required privileges of a service.\n          managedaccount--Changes the service to mark the service account password as managed by LSA.\n          qc--------------Queries the configuration information for a service.\n          qdescription----Queries the description for a service.\n          qfailure--------Queries the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          qfailureflag----Queries the failure actions flag of a service.\n          qsidtype--------Queries the service SID type of a service.\n          qprivs----------Queries the required privileges of a service.\n          qtriggerinfo----Queries the trigger parameters of a service.\n          qpreferrednode--Queries the preferred NUMA node of a service.\n          qrunlevel-------Queries the run level of a service.\n          qmanagedaccount-Queries whether a services uses an account with a password managed by LSA.\n          qprotection-----Queries the process protection level of a service.\n          delete----------Deletes a service (from the registry).\n          create----------Creates a service.

[ y | n ]:\n```\n\nWow. That's a monster of a command documentation. Let's break down what we need.\n\n- The server name. We know that (for this example, I'm going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There's a gotchya, we will need to write it like:\n\n`\\\\AWESOMESERVER01`\n\nThat's not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that's part of the `sc` command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:\n\n> > The option <server> has the form \"\\\\\\\\ServerName\"\n\nOkay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I'm going to call our service `ServiceName even with Whitespace`.\n\nOkay, what do I need to send as a command? What command do we need? Let's check out that wall of text documentation:\n\n> > stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.\n\nYep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:\n\n> > Commands:\n  . . .\n  start-----------Starts a service.\n\nThat will be useful later, too.\n\nAlright... Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:\n\n`sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"`\n\nIn order for this to be a true _restart_ of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:\n\n`sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"`  \n`sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start \"ServiceName even with Whitespace\"`\n\nHow do we do that in ABAP? Well, to run SM69 commands programmatically, we have the tasty function module `SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE`:\n\n```abap\nCALL FUNCTION 'SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE'\n  EXPORTING\n    commandname                   = gv_commandname\n    additional_parameters         = gv_additional_parameters\n    operatingsystem               = gv_operatingsystem\n  TABLES\n    exec_protocol                 = gt_result\n  EXCEPTIONS\n    no_permission                 = 1\n    command_not_found             = 2\n    parameters_too_long           = 3\n    security_risk                 = 4\n    wrong_check_call_interface    = 5\n    program_start_error           = 6\n    program_termination_error     = 7\n    x_error                       = 8\n    parameter_expected            = 9\n    too_many_parameters           = 10\n    illegal_command               = 11\n    wrong_asynchronous_parameters = 12\n    cant_enq_tbtco_entry          = 13\n    jobcount_generation_error     = 14\n    OTHERS                        = 15.\n```\n\nI'll just say I maintained the two commands in SM69 as `Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_START` and `Z_MY_SUPER_AWESOME_COMMAND_STOP`.\n\nSo, all that's left is to check if the service is not responding. As I summarized above, if the Windows service was broken, the RFC node that talked to it would also be broken. (i.e. pinging it would not work). An RFC node is easy enough to test with function module `RFC_PING`.\n\n```abap\nCALL FUNCTION 'RFC_PING'\n  DESTINATION 'Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION'\n  EXCEPTIONS\n    system_failure        = 1\n    communication_failure = 2.\n```\n\nEasy enough. If `sy-subrc` is of value 1 or 2, then it means indeed, that our `Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION` is indeed broken.\n\nSo if it turns out this service is not responding, we call the command pair with function module `SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE`, check `sy-subrc`, and we are done! The total code looks like this:\n\n```abap\nREPORT Z_RESTART_SERVICE.\n*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*\n*& Report:  Z_RESTART_SERVICE                                          *\n*& Author: Chris Frewin                                                *\n*& Creation Date: 27.10.2017                                           *\n*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*\n*& Requester:                                                          *\n*& Chris Frewin - a report that restarts a windows service             *\n*&                                                                     *\n*&                                                                     *\n*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*\n*& Changes:                                                            *\n*& Chris Frewin      2017.12.13 - First version                        *\n*&                                                                     *\n*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*\n\n\" Check RFC destination Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION - if it hangs or returns error, try to restart it\nCALL FUNCTION 'RFC_PING'\n  DESTINATION 'Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION'\n  EXCEPTIONS\n    system_failure        = 1\n    communication_failure = 2.\nIF sy-subrc <> 0.\n  CASE sy-subrc.\n    WHEN 1.\n      WRITE: / 'Ping Test RFC Destination Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION with SY-SUBRC = 1: \"system_failure\" Trying to restart the service...'.\n    WHEN 2.\n      WRITE: / 'Ping Test RFC Destination Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION with SY-SUBRC = 2: \"communication_failure\" Trying to restart the service...'.\n    WHEN OTHERS.\n      WRITE: / 'Ping Test RFC Destination Z_BROKEN_RFC_DESTINATION is offline or not functioning properly!

However, with such a huge library comes the fact that the documentation can be a bit of a maze to get through. I mean, for the text to speech (TTS) API we'll be talking about in this post, for the getting started guide (in \"five minutes!!!\" as it says on the site), they provide this old-school bash `curl` command:\n\n```bash\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer \"$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token) -H \"Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\" --data \"{\n  'input':{\n    'text':'Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.'\n  },\n  'voice':{\n    'languageCode':'en-gb',\n    'name':'en-GB-Standard-A',\n    'ssmlGender':'FEMALE'\n  },\n  'audioConfig':{\n    'audioEncoding':'MP3'\n  }\n}\" \"https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/text:synthesize\" > synthesize-output.txt\n```\n\nI mean what the heck is that? The `$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)` did _not_ work for me. Even if it did, the following steps included extracting the base64 encoded string (which is only a part of the downloaded curl file) to another file, _and then_ converting that base64 file to an mp3 file. No thank you, I'm going to do it all at runtime!\n\nLong story short, I've found that this time and like many times before, using Google's APIs is usually a lot of trial and error to get the endpoints working. <sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\">1</a></sup>\n\nIt wasn't until I got to Google's interactive POST console for their TTS module which you can use to test endpoints that I got a basic request working. That's how I determined the bare minimum API request required below.\n\n# You're in Luck 😎\n\nThere's good news: luckily for you, I can spare you the migrain/hair pulling/rage that may ensue when trying to wrap your mind around Google's often spotty documentation. I managed to get the TTS endpoint working, in Node.js nonetheless. In Node.js JavaScript, here is the code for converting some typed text to a tasty mp3 (granted you have a valid API key generated from googles cloud console for the )\n\n**_Note that you need the following prerequisites for this to work!_**\n- be in a node project `npm init -y`\n- axios installed `npm install --save axios`\n- your google TTS module API key exported (in your `.bash_profile` or similar) as `GOOGLE_CLOUD_TEXT_TO_SPEECH_API`, i.e. that would be this line of bash:\n\n`export GOOGLE_CLOUD_TEXT_TO_SPEECH_API=blahblahblahblah`\n\n- the following in `index.js`:\n\n```javascript\nlet oResponse;\nvar axios = require('axios');\nvar fs = require('fs');\nconst sMainText = \"hello world\";\nconst oData = {\n  \"input\":\n  {\n    \"text\": sMainText\n  },\n  \"voice\":\n  {\n    \"languageCode\": \"en-GB\",\n    \"ssmlGender\": \"FEMALE\"\n  },\n  \"audioConfig\":\n  {\n    \"audioEncoding\": \"mp3\"\n  }\n};\naxios.post(\"https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/text:synthesize?fields=audioContent&key=\" + process.env.GOOGLE_CLOUD_TEXT_TO_SPEECH_API, oData)\n.then(function (oResponse) {\n  // write dat baoss (an encoded string) response into an mp3 file\n  fs.writeFileSync('outfile.mp3', oResponse.data.audioContent, 'base64', function(err) { // write this base64 to an mp3\n    console.log(err);\n  });\n  console.log(\"MP3 file generated and saved!

Just thinking about my own situation, right now, I'm 100x better off than I was just 3 years ago, when I was 23, $27K in debt from my bachelor degree, and earning less than _half_ of what I do now! How come nobody back then said:\n\n> Don't do this don't do this don't do this\n\nBecause being a homely, unkempt, poor graduate student is _expected_ by society, (although graduate school is even looked upon with reverence in some cases - \"Wow, _Cornell_? Great school, great school.\"). But what the hell are people thinking? In terms of net worth back then, I was totally screwed!\n\nIf you are in your mid-20s reading this, you're probably in the same situation of a strongly improved financial situation. So, why would I risk going total freelance when I have a house and kids, when _real_ bills need to be paid? You're right - I wouldn't. \n\nThe way I see it, now is not only the _only_ time to try this, it's the _perfect_ time: experience and network connections from my first few years at a big industry job, with a bunch of savings as an all-else fails cushion in the bank.\n\nEven a lot of well-known 'creatives' these days also say not to do this until you have a self-sustaining (or better yet - profitable) side project, but I just couldn't help but writing that notion off - most of them quit their jobs themselves when they were getting started! Yes - they talk about the strife and challenge it was from doing that, which is why they don't recommend it to anyone else - but isn't that exactly the ingredient required in the recipe of nearly all people who were once nobody and emerged with amazing projects and products? \n\nIf you want to create truly nice projects of high quality, that aren't just patched together, even if you are hacking away those 4-5 hours a night, _after_ your full-time job, you just can't. Well - at least I can't. \n\nIn my case, I need those multiple 12 hour, interrupted days, diving deep and building complex projects. This just isn't sustainable with a full-time job - and indeed, perhaps this is exactly the 'strife' and 'challenge' that these creatives refer to in all of their 'early days'. It's true - while we all complain about our 9-5 jobs (in my case, 7-5), you can't help but admitting there is a lot of comfortability and security in them - weekdays only, and (for most of us) 5PM is 5PM, when the clock hits 5, there's no more work for the day. It will be interesting to see how that goes in my freelance life.\n\nBut hey, it's 2018, and \"quitting your day job\", especially as a software engineer, doesn't really mean you're immediately 'unemployed' - right? There were a large number of supporting variables and events over the past few months that have led me to my decision:\n\n- talking to [torch.io](torch.io) over a possible part time frontend consulting work\n- being added to the [Moonlight Community](moonlightwork.com)\n- talking to a colleague about a fixed part-time position at his software company\n- working with a friend to build a keyboard that charges as you type (I know it sounds like magic but the science and numbers show it can work) [charge-keyboard.com](https://charge-keyboard.com)\n- building out and advertising my startup Siren Apparel, and expanding to the EU [https://sirenapparel.us](https://sirenapparel.us), [https://sirenapparel.eu](https://sirenapparel.eu)\n- (only knowing after I quit) consulting opportunities at my current company\n\nSo yes, any one or a combination of these will pay the bills.\n\nI realize, _none_ of these (or probably even a combination) will pay as high as my comfy logistic / warehousing full-time job. But I also realized over the past few months, _I don't give a damn about money!_ Sure, I could go the Mr. Money Mustache route and just keep truckin' away at my current job with a high savings rate, and become financially independent in 7-8 years. But to me, that's 7-8 years of sunk cost, working at albeit a decent, but ultimately where-I-don't-want-to-be job. If I spent those 7-8 years building out projects that:\n\n1. Allow me enough income to survive\n\nand \n\n2. Are valuable projects that I value and believe make a difference in the world\n\nThen I have many many years after that to continue building, instead of after those 7-8 years, starting 'fresh' only with the single added confidence that I am financially independent. \n\nWorst case, I fail and a year from now I run back to the security of a full-time job. (Hopefully not the case!)\n\nIt's a similar story with options trading, [another toy project of mine](https://medium.com/@frewin.christopher/i-set-aside-1000-to-learn-options-trading-b32bf47db656). A lot of people say you can learn a lot from paper trading, but people with real trading experience say you can never really learn unless real money is on the line. If I springboard into the abyss that is freelance / maker / creative / digital nomad, I'm _forced_ to do my best work, and a lot of it, because it's the only chance I have to pay my bills.

These 'objects' in SAP are numerous - orders, HUs, even warehouse bins are 'objects' that can be 'locked' when they are under modification somewhere in the system.\n\nThis can get very annoying when multiple entities want to change multiple objects in similar time frames.\n\n## A Remedy for the Problem\n\nThe ABAP report I'm going to go through alleviates this problem and could be useful for any company that has automatic processes applied to objects in the system, but at the same time have human users that _also_ modify these objects.\n\nThe example program I will go through is for orders specifically (think TYPE AUFNR). Feel free to modify the code for any locked objects of your liking 😊 - the program logic following the locked object selection will not change, as we will soon see.\n\n## Specific Problem\n\nAt my company we had some batch jobs that were attempting to change orders, only to find that the users were locked by some of our employees in their own SAP GUI transactions. Nothing 'bad' per say was happening, we were just seeing in the protocol of those various batch jobs that the orders couldn't be accessed. We realized a human user could easily forget they had a transaction open which locked an order, while they went off to work on something else, or were totally away from their work station.\n\nWe decided ultimately to build a timed warning system for users that happened to be locking orders, functioning as follows:\n\n1. A warning popup for the user at 5 minutes of lock time\n2. A second warning popup for the user warning at 10 minutes of lock time\n3. Forcefully close the transaction that was locking the order at 15 minutes of lock time\n\nAnd yes, this can all be done from an automatic process with no overseeing required! 😊\n\nLet's get started!\n\n## Identify Locked Objects\n\nThe first thing we need to do is get the locked objects and times of all those locked objects across the whole system. As I said, for this example case, we are only interested in locked _orders_. This is object type `AUFK` - the order head table. To get a list of all locked object across the system with this type, we can use function module `ENQUEUE_READ`\n\n```abap\n\" Get all AUFK table locks\nCALL FUNCTION 'ENQUEUE_READ'\n  EXPORTING\n    gname                 = 'AUFK'\n    guname                = '*'              \" Users (all)\n  TABLES\n    enq                   = gt_enq\n  EXCEPTIONS\n    communication_failure = 1\n    system_failure        = 2\n    OTHERS                = 3.\n```\n\nSo, by now we have our table of objects, and the users who are locking them. We will also need all the sessions open across the system. We can get that with the nice SAP Standard class `cl_server_info` (pretty obvious name, eh? 😂). \n\n```abap\n\" Get all user sessions\nCREATE OBJECT server_info.\ngt_session_list = server_info->get_session_list( with_application_info = 1 ).\n```\n\nHowever, we can't just kill all of a user's sessions - we only want to shut down (indeed, this is bad luck for the user that has only one SAP application window open that is blocking an order, but hey, they get two warnings before we shut them down)\n\n## The 'Forbidden' Kernel Call\n\nTo get the fidelity needed to find exactly which index of SAP application window, we're gonna have go down the system rabbithole and use a f (remember, it is always 1-7 --> the classic SAP limit of 7 open windows per client)\n\n```abap\nCALL 'ThUsrInfo' ID 'OPCODE' FIELD opcode_usr_info\n          ID 'TID' FIELD gs_session_list-logon_hdl\n          ID 'WITH_APPL_INFO' FIELD with_appl_info\n          ID 'TABLE' FIELD gt_usr_info[].\n```\n\nWhat this kernel call retrieves and puts in table `gt_user_info` can be also found be found through the standard SAP GUI in transaction `SM04` by selecting a session and going to the top menu bar and selecting User->Technical Information):\n\n![How to navigate to technical information in SAP GUI transaction SM04](technical-information.png)\n\nYou will see a giant list of multiple fields for each session number (0-6) that the user has open. So, what can we do with this giant technical information list of key value pairs? \n\nIn SAP, this works as follows: each _login_ by a user (not session number, we're not there yet 😄)  is assigned a unique login ID which is generated based on things you log in with: the client number, system, and language. This session ID has the form of `TXX_UXXXXX`, where `X` can be any number 0-9. \n\nEach session then has a session ID which is comprised of first the login ID as described above, with an appended `_MX`, where `X` in this case is the session number, 0-6 (session 1-7). So, we are interested in the `.session` value of this technical list:\n\n![Session ID in the technical information.](session-id.png)\n\nYou can notice then that session 2 would have \n\n`modeinfo[1].session = T23_U31974_M1` \n\nsession 3 would have\n\n`modeinfo[2].session = T23_U31974_M2` \n\nand so on, all the way up to session 7 - or index 6. We will see in the code that I leverage this pattern. The only way to find the true session that is blocking the order is to first guess the logon instance for the user (in the case for example that htey have logged on with multiple languages), then you can back out all the session ID's until you get a match of the `session_hdl` from the returned list of `gt_sessions_list`.\n\n```abap\nCLEAR gt_sessions_user.\nLOOP AT gt_session_list INTO gs_session_list WHERE tenant EQ sy-mandt. \" loop at all open sessions to build a list of just the user sessions\n\n  \" if a user is not in the given so, we continue (that means with exclude users, they are skipped, those with equals and all others keep going)\n  IF gs_session_list-user_name NOT IN so_bname.\n    CONTINUE.\n  ENDIF.\n\n  gv_user_name   = gs_session_list-user_name.\n\n  \" Only add to list if user is current lock user - also get the session id for this user\n  IF gv_user_name EQ gs_enq-guname.\n    CLEAR gv_modus_index.\n    CLEAR gt_usr_info[].\n    CLEAR gs_usr_info.\n    \" get detailed technical info for this user to find which specific session to close\n    CALL 'ThUsrInfo' ID 'OPCODE' FIELD opcode_usr_info\n      ID 'TID' FIELD gs_session_list-logon_hdl\n      ID 'WITH_APPL_INFO' FIELD with_appl_info\n      ID 'TABLE' FIELD gt_usr_info[].\n    CONCATENATE gs_enq-gusrvb '/UPD' INTO gv_value. \" We need to use the '/UPD' value in the technical info to get the exact session assigned to the specific locked object\n    LOOP AT gt_usr_info INTO gs_usr_info WHERE value EQ gv_value. \" find the field from the value\n      gv_modus_index = gs_usr_info-field+9(1). \" the key for the value is 'modeinfo[X].enq_info'.... we need just the X.. so we +9 then take the single character (1)\n    ENDLOOP.\n    \" If we found a session with that number, we know we had the correct logon... we can add this to the user list\n    IF gv_modus_index IS NOT INITIAL.\n      \" convert to type ssi_session_handle for later lookup\n      gv_modus_num_found = gv_modus_index.\n      \" get the session id for this specific\n      CONCATENATE 'modeinfo[' gv_modus_index '].session' INTO gv_field. \" this time we need to find the value from the field\n      LOOP AT gt_usr_info INTO gs_usr_info WHERE field EQ gv_field.\n        gv_ssi_session_id = gs_usr_info-value.\n      ENDLOOP.\n      APPEND gs_session_list TO gt_sessions_user.\n    ENDIF.\n  ENDIF.\nENDLOOP.\n```\n\nHere - as will make more sense in the full code - I am building a `gt_sessions_user` list on the fly, which is what is passed to a BDC method to close that specific session ID for that user alone (explained below). I decided to run the program with this one-user-at-a-time method in order to have the minimum amount of time between finding a session that was locking an object and messaging / deleting that session. \n\nIf we had say, 1000 locked orders on our system, and I built an entire list of all blocking sessions across all users, it could be the case that by the time we get to the BDC method (which, by the way, is slow itself, especially when you need it to be synchronous as we need in this process), the user could have already closed that blocking session, or worse, switched to a transaction in that session number which was no longer blocking the order! In such a case we would be unnecessarily sending warning messages or closing the transaction to a session which didn't apply anymore! Bad.\n\nSo - we've pinpointed the exact user and their session number that is blocking the order - let's send them our warning messages at 5 and 10 minutes.\n\n## No Way! A _SECOND_ 'Forbidden' Module?!\n\nTo send a popup message to a user, we need to now make use of _second_ `TH*` function, `TH_POPUP` (though at least this time it is at least a SAP function, and not a sneaky system function):\n\n```abap\nCONCATENATE 'You are locking' gv_aufnr_string 'in TC' gv_tcode ' for >5min. Please save and leave the transaction.' INTO gv_message SEPARATED BY space.\n    CALL FUNCTION 'TH_POPUP'\n      EXPORTING\n        client         = sy-mandt\n        user           = gs_enq-guname\n        message        = gv_message\n      EXCEPTIONS\n        user_not_found = 1\n        OTHERS         = 2.\n```\n\nThis function module actually heads to the kernel as well, because the user won't get a popup directly in the SAP GUI, but rather a warning message directly in the their operating system. It looks like this when testing from `SE37`:\n\n![Testing TH_POPUP in transaction SE37.](TH_POPUP-function-test.png)\n\nAnd our resulting system popup (at least how it looks on windows operating system)\n\n![What a successful call of TH_POPUP from SE37 looks like.](TH_POPUP-result.png)\n\nOk, so we've warned the users twice by now with our popup, but they still are blocking a dang order! Remember, each run we've still got their exact session number that is blocking the order, so let's finally go in for the kill and shut down that session! Once we do that, we log which session/user/transaction combo we deleted to the spool, and this report is done!\n\n## BDC Tricks To Finally Close The User Session\n\nI searched and searched, but there seems to be no function module that can explicitely close a specific user session - there's probably good reason for this! (Though I can't _possibly_ think of why 🤔 😉) \n\nI couldn't even find another 'forbidden' `Th****` function module that can do this. However, this _is_ possible through the standard SAP GUI, and we've already mentioned it in this post, our friend transaction `SM04`. By double clicking on a user (using me for an example), we get a list like this (sorry for the black boxes - don't want to inadvertantly reveal anything that may be proprietary):\n\n![List of user sessions on the server.](server-sessions-list.png)\n\nThen you need only select the desired session number and click \"Delete Session\", then ☁POOF!☁ that user's session will be gone!\n\n![Deleting a user session by session number.](delete-session.png)\n\nThank me later, but in BDC form, this can be written as follows:\n\n```abap\n\" First ensure that sm04 is called and set to the sessions view\n      CLEAR bdcdata[].\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPMSSY0' '0120',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' '04/03',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=SESSIONS'.\n      \" call transaction SM04, sync (S), no screens unless debugger (P)\n      CALL TRANSACTION 'SM04'\n              USING bdcdata\n              MODE 'P'\n              UPDATE 'S'.\n\n      \" Now use bdc to end the session with that session id\n      CLEAR bdcdata[].\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPMSSY0' '0120',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' '04/03',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=&OL0'.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPLSKBH' '0800',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' 'GT_FIELD_LIST-SELTEXT(01)',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=WLSE',\n          ' ' 'GT_FIELD_LIST-MARK(01)' 'X',\n          ' ' 'BDC_SUBSCR' 'SAPLSKBH                                0810SUB810'.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPLSKBH' '0800',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' 'GT_FIELD_LIST-SELTEXT(01)',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=CONT',\n          ' ' 'BDC_SUBSCR' 'SAPLSKBH                                0810SUB810'.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPMSSY0' '0120',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' '04/03',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=PS 63'.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPMSSY0' '0120',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' '02/76',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=&IC1'.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPMSSY0' '0120',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' '02/76',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=&ILT'.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPLSSEL' '1104',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=CRET',\n          ' ' 'BDC_SUBSCR' 'SAPLSSEL                                1105%_SUBSCREEN_FREESEL',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' '%%DYN001-LOW',\n          ' ' '%%DYN001-LOW' gv_ssi_session_id.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPMSSY0' '0120',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' '04/15',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=&IC1'.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'RSM04000_ALV_NEW' '2000',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' gv_modus_string,\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=DEL'.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPMSSY0' '0120',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' '04/15',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=&F15'.\n      \" call transaction SM04, sync (S), no screens unless debugger (P)\n      CALL TRANSACTION 'SM04'\n              USING bdcdata\n              MODE 'P'\n              UPDATE 'S'.\n```\n\nIf you stick around the blog and or read other ABAP BDC posts of mine, you'll see for BDC I always use the following helper form `bdcdaten` that allows me to write the BDC so cleanly (as it is above):\n\n```abap\n*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*\n*&      Form  BDCDATEN\n*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*\nFORM bdcdaten USING start fnam fval.\n\n  CLEAR bdcdata.\n  IF start = 'X'.\n    bdcdata-dynbegin = start.\n    bdcdata-program  = fnam.\n    bdcdata-dynpro   = fval.\n  ELSE.\n    bdcdata-fnam = fnam.\n    bdcdata-fval = fval.\n  ENDIF.\n  APPEND bdcdata.\n\nENDFORM.                               \" BDCDATEN\n```\n\nThe only thing worth noting here is in our first step we always ensure the server view of `SM04` is active - we need to always run in server view, because we don't want all sessions across all servers. In this way, this report can run in parallel on all your servers and concern it self only with users logged on to the server instance that this report is running on. This will make the run time a bit faster, and of course splits up the search work across all servers.\n\n# Full Code\n\nThe full code of the report is as follows:\n\n```abap\nREPORT z_user_session_kill.\n*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*\n*& Report: Z_USER_SESSION_KILL                                         *\n*& Author: Christopher Frewin                                          *\n*& Creation Date: 2018.05.09                                           *\n*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*\n*&                                                                     *\n*&                                                                     *\n*&                                                         __          *\n*&                                           Christophe_r_|  |_F_rewin *\n*&                                                     |__    __|      *\n*&                                                        |  |         *\n*&                                \"Z_USER_SESSION_KILL\"   |  |         *\n*&                                                        |__|  17'    *\n*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*\n\n\" table needed for FOR in select-options statement\nTABLES: usr02.\n\n\" Data...  :)\nDATA: gv_time_dif_sperr   TYPE tims,\n      gv_tcode            TYPE eqetcode,\n      gv_aufnr            TYPE aufnr,\n      gv_message          TYPE sm04dic-popupmsg,\n      gv_objnr            TYPE j_objnr,\n      gv_stat             TYPE j_status,\n      gt_enq              TYPE TABLE OF seqg3,\n      gs_enq              LIKE LINE OF gt_enq,\n      server_info         TYPE REF TO cl_server_info,\n      gt_session_list     TYPE TABLE OF ssi_session_info,\n      gs_session_list     LIKE LINE OF gt_session_list,\n      gt_sessions_user    TYPE TABLE OF ssi_session_info,\n      gs_sessions_user    LIKE LINE OF gt_sessions_user,\n      bdcdata             LIKE bdcdata OCCURS 0 WITH HEADER LINE,\n      gv_modus_string     TYPE string,\n      gv_modus_index      TYPE string,\n      gv_user_name        TYPE eqeuname,\n      th_opcode(1)        TYPE x,\n      with_appl_info      TYPE ssi_bool VALUE 1,\n      gv_field(40),\n      gv_value(80),\n      gv_ssi_session_id   TYPE ssi_session_id,\n      gv_modus_num        TYPE ssi_session_hdl,\n      gv_modus_num_found  TYPE ssi_session_hdl,\n      gv_modus_index_char TYPE numc1,\n      gv_aufnr_string     TYPE string,\n      BEGIN OF gt_usr_info OCCURS 10,\n        field(40),\n        VALUE(80),\n      END OF gt_usr_info,\n      gs_usr_info LIKE LINE OF gt_usr_info,\n      gv_autyp    TYPE auftyp,\n      gv_uzeit    TYPE sy-uzeit,\n      gv_string   TYPE string.\n\n\" select option to exlude user\nSELECT-OPTIONS: so_bname FOR usr02-bname MEMORY ID xus NO INTERVALS.\n\nCONSTANTS: opcode_usr_info LIKE th_opcode VALUE 52. \" this is the internal SAP number used for the system function module 'ThUsrInfo'\ngv_uzeit = sy-uzeit. \" moved up here to have time before the enqueue_read function\n\n\" Get all AUFK table locks\nCALL FUNCTION 'ENQUEUE_READ'\n  EXPORTING\n    gname                 = 'AUFK'\n    guname                = '*'              \" Users (all)\n  TABLES\n    enq                   = gt_enq\n  EXCEPTIONS\n    communication_failure = 1\n    system_failure        = 2\n    OTHERS                = 3.\nIF sy-subrc <> 0.\n  EXIT.\nENDIF.\n\n\" Get all user sessions\nCREATE OBJECT server_info.\ngt_session_list = server_info->get_session_list( with_application_info = 1 ).\n\n\" Loop through each locked object (production orders)\nLOOP AT gt_enq INTO gs_enq.\n\n  \" Auftrag and Tcode for nice printing in the messages\n  gv_tcode = gs_enq-gtcode.\n  gv_aufnr_string = gs_enq-garg+3.\n  SHIFT gv_aufnr_string LEFT DELETING LEADING '0'.\n  CONDENSE gv_tcode.\n\n  \" We keep only the orders that have the status FREI ---> stat 'I0002' in table JEST\n  gv_aufnr = gs_enq-garg+3. \" GARG for aufnr is in the format '10000000XXXXXXX' therefore with +3 we should have the standard aufnr format 00000XXXXXXX (12 CHAR long)\n\n  \" Only orders with type 10 or 40 (production and proess orders)\n  CLEAR gv_autyp.\n  SELECT SINGLE autyp FROM aufk INTO gv_autyp\n    WHERE aufnr EQ gv_aufnr.\n  IF gv_autyp NE '10' AND gv_autyp NE '40'.\n    DELETE gt_enq INDEX sy-tabix. \" delete this line\n    CONTINUE. \" and go on to the next lock object in gt_enq\n  ENDIF.\n\n  \" Also check JEST table -

These 'objects' in SAP are numerous - orders, HUs, even warehouse bins are 'objects' that can be 'locked' when they are under modification somewhere in the system.\n\nThis can get very annoying when multiple entities want to change multiple objects in similar time frames.\n\n## A Remedy for the Problem\n\nThe ABAP report I'm going to go through alleviates this problem and could be useful for any company that has automatic processes applied to objects in the system, but at the same time have human users that _also_ modify these objects.\n\nThe example program I will go through is for orders specifically (think TYPE AUFNR). Feel free to modify the code for any locked objects of your liking :blush: - the program logic following the locked object selection will not change, as we will soon see.\n\n## Specific Problem\n\nAt my company we had some batch jobs that were attempting to change orders, only to find that the users were locked by some of our employees in their own SAP GUI transactions. Nothing 'bad' per say was happening, we were just seeing in the protocol of those various batch jobs that the orders couldn't be accessed. We realized a human user could easily forget they had a transaction open which locked an order, while they went off to work on something else, or were totally away from their work station.\n\nWe decided ultimately to build a timed warning system for users that happened to be locking orders, functioning as follows:\n\n1. A warning popup for the user at 5 minutes of lock time\n2. A second warning popup for the user warning at 10 minutes of lock time\n3. Forcefully close the transaction that was locking the order at 15 minutes of lock time\n\nAnd yes, this can all be done from an automatic process with no overseeing required! :blush:\n\nLet's get started!\n\n## Identify Locked Objects\n\nThe first thing we need to do is get the locked objects and times of all those locked objects across the whole system. As I said, for this example case, we are only interested in locked _orders_. This is object type `AUFK` - the order head table. To get a list of all locked object across the system with this type, we can use function module `ENQUEUE_READ`\n\n```abap\n\" Get all AUFK table locks\nCALL FUNCTION 'ENQUEUE_READ'\n  EXPORTING\n    gname                 = 'AUFK'\n    guname                = '*'              \" Users (all)\n  TABLES\n    enq                   = gt_enq\n  EXCEPTIONS\n    communication_failure = 1\n    system_failure        = 2\n    OTHERS                = 3.\n```\n\nSo, by now we have our table of objects, and the users who are locking them. We will also need all the sessions open across the system. We can get that with the nice SAP Standard class `cl_server_info` (pretty obvious name, eh? :joy:). \n\n```abap\n\" Get all user sessions\nCREATE OBJECT server_info.\ngt_session_list = server_info->get_session_list( with_application_info = 1 ).\n```\n\nHowever, we can't just kill all of a user's sessions - we only want to shut down (indeed, this is bad luck for the user that has only one SAP application window open that is blocking an order, but hey, they get two warnings before we shut them down)\n\n## The 'Forbidden' Kernel Call\n\nTo get the fidelity needed to find exactly which index of SAP application window, we're gonna have go down the system rabbithole and use a f (remember, it is always 1-7 --> the classic SAP limit of 7 open windows per client)\n\n```abap\nCALL 'ThUsrInfo' ID 'OPCODE' FIELD opcode_usr_info\n          ID 'TID' FIELD gs_session_list-logon_hdl\n          ID 'WITH_APPL_INFO' FIELD with_appl_info\n          ID 'TABLE' FIELD gt_usr_info[].\n```\n\nWhat this kernel call retrieves and puts in table `gt_user_info` can be also found be found through the standard SAP GUI in transaction `SM04` by selecting a session and going to the top menu bar and selecting User->Technical Information):\n\n![How to navigate to technical information in SAP GUI transaction SM04](technical-information.png)\n\nYou will see a giant list of multiple fields for each session number (0-6) that the user has open. So, what can we do with this giant technical information list of key value pairs? \n\nIn SAP, this works as follows: each _login_ by a user (not session number, we're not there yet :smile:)  is assigned a unique login ID which is generated based on things you log in with: the client number, system, and language. This session ID has the form of `TXX_UXXXXX`, where `X` can be any number 0-9. \n\nEach session then has a session ID which is comprised of first the login ID as described above, with an appended `_MX`, where `X` in this case is the session number, 0-6 (session 1-7). So, we are interested in the `.session` value of this technical list:\n\n![Session ID in the technical information.](session-id.png)\n\nYou can notice then that session 2 would have \n\n`modeinfo[1].session = T23_U31974_M1` \n\nsession 3 would have\n\n`modeinfo[2].session = T23_U31974_M2` \n\nand so on, all the way up to session 7 - or index 6. We will see in the code that I leverage this pattern. The only way to find the true session that is blocking the order is to first guess the logon instance for the user (in the case for example that htey have logged on with multiple languages), then you can back out all the session ID's until you get a match of the `session_hdl` from the returned list of `gt_sessions_list`.\n\n```abap\nCLEAR gt_sessions_user.\nLOOP AT gt_session_list INTO gs_session_list WHERE tenant EQ sy-mandt. \" loop at all open sessions to build a list of just the user sessions\n\n  \" if a user is not in the given so, we continue (that means with exclude users, they are skipped, those with equals and all others keep going)\n  IF gs_session_list-user_name NOT IN so_bname.\n    CONTINUE.\n  ENDIF.\n\n  gv_user_name   = gs_session_list-user_name.\n\n  \" Only add to list if user is current lock user - also get the session id for this user\n  IF gv_user_name EQ gs_enq-guname.\n    CLEAR gv_modus_index.\n    CLEAR gt_usr_info[].\n    CLEAR gs_usr_info.\n    \" get detailed technical info for this user to find which specific session to close\n    CALL 'ThUsrInfo' ID 'OPCODE' FIELD opcode_usr_info\n      ID 'TID' FIELD gs_session_list-logon_hdl\n      ID 'WITH_APPL_INFO' FIELD with_appl_info\n      ID 'TABLE' FIELD gt_usr_info[].\n    CONCATENATE gs_enq-gusrvb '/UPD' INTO gv_value. \" We need to use the '/UPD' value in the technical info to get the exact session assigned to the specific locked object\n    LOOP AT gt_usr_info INTO gs_usr_info WHERE value EQ gv_value. \" find the field from the value\n      gv_modus_index = gs_usr_info-field+9(1). \" the key for the value is 'modeinfo[X].enq_info'.... we need just the X.. so we +9 then take the single character (1)\n    ENDLOOP.\n    \" If we found a session with that number, we know we had the correct logon... we can add this to the user list\n    IF gv_modus_index IS NOT INITIAL.\n      \" convert to type ssi_session_handle for later lookup\n      gv_modus_num_found = gv_modus_index.\n      \" get the session id for this specific\n      CONCATENATE 'modeinfo[' gv_modus_index '].session' INTO gv_field. \" this time we need to find the value from the field\n      LOOP AT gt_usr_info INTO gs_usr_info WHERE field EQ gv_field.\n        gv_ssi_session_id = gs_usr_info-value.\n      ENDLOOP.\n      APPEND gs_session_list TO gt_sessions_user.\n    ENDIF.\n  ENDIF.\nENDLOOP.\n```\n\nHere - as will make more sense in the full code - I am building a `gt_sessions_user` list on the fly, which is what is passed to a BDC method to close that specific session ID for that user alone (explained below). I decided to run the program with this one-user-at-a-time method in order to have the minimum amount of time between finding a session that was locking an object and messaging / deleting that session. \n\nIf we had say, 1000 locked orders on our system, and I built an entire list of all blocking sessions across all users, it could be the case that by the time we get to the BDC method (which, by the way, is slow itself, especially when you need it to be synchronous as we need in this process), the user could have already closed that blocking session, or worse, switched to a transaction in that session number which was no longer blocking the order! In such a case we would be unnecessarily sending warning messages or closing the transaction to a session which didn't apply anymore! Bad.\n\nSo - we've pinpointed the exact user and their session number that is blocking the order - let's send them our warning messages at 5 and 10 minutes.\n\n## No Way! A _SECOND_ 'Forbidden' Module?!\n\nTo send a popup message to a user, we need to now make use of _second_ `TH*` function, `TH_POPUP` (though at least this time it is at least a SAP function, and not a sneaky system function):\n\n```abap\nCONCATENATE 'You are locking' gv_aufnr_string 'in TC' gv_tcode ' for >5min. Please save and leave the transaction.' INTO gv_message SEPARATED BY space.\n    CALL FUNCTION 'TH_POPUP'\n      EXPORTING\n        client         = sy-mandt\n        user           = gs_enq-guname\n        message        = gv_message\n      EXCEPTIONS\n        user_not_found = 1\n        OTHERS         = 2.\n```\n\nThis function module actually heads to the kernel as well, because the user won't get a popup directly in the SAP GUI, but rather a warning message directly in the their operating system. It looks like this when testing from `SE37`:\n\n![Testing TH_POPUP in transaction SE37.](TH_POPUP-function-test.png)\n\nAnd our resulting system popup (at least how it looks on windows operating system)\n\n![What a successful call of TH_POPUP from SE37 looks like.](TH_POPUP-result.png)\n\nOk, so we've warned the users twice by now with our popup, but they still are blocking a dang order! Remember, each run we've still got their exact session number that is blocking the order, so let's finally go in for the kill and shut down that session! Once we do that, we log which session/user/transaction combo we deleted to the spool, and this report is done!\n\n## BDC Tricks To Finally Close The User Session\n\nI searched and searched, but there seems to be no function module that can explicitely close a specific user session - there's probably good reason for this! (Though I can't _possibly_ think of why :thinking: :wink:) \n\nI couldn't even find another 'forbidden' `Th****` function module that can do this. However, this _is_ possible through the standard SAP GUI, and we've already mentioned it in this post, our friend transaction `SM04`. By double clicking on a user (using me for an example), we get a list like this (sorry for the black boxes - don't want to inadvertantly reveal anything that may be proprietary):\n\n![List of user sessions on the server.](server-sessions-list.png)\n\nThen you need only select the desired session number and click \"Delete Session\", then :cloud:POOF!:cloud: that user's session will be gone!\n\n![Deleting a user session by session number.](delete-session.png)\n\nThank me later, but in BDC form, this can be written as follows:\n\n```abap\n\" First ensure that sm04 is called and set to the sessions view\n      CLEAR bdcdata[].\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPMSSY0' '0120',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' '04/03',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=SESSIONS'.\n      \" call transaction SM04, sync (S), no screens unless debugger (P)\n      CALL TRANSACTION 'SM04'\n              USING bdcdata\n              MODE 'P'\n              UPDATE 'S'.\n\n      \" Now use bdc to end the session with that session id\n      CLEAR bdcdata[].\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPMSSY0' '0120',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' '04/03',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=&OL0'.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPLSKBH' '0800',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' 'GT_FIELD_LIST-SELTEXT(01)',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=WLSE',\n          ' ' 'GT_FIELD_LIST-MARK(01)' 'X',\n          ' ' 'BDC_SUBSCR' 'SAPLSKBH                                0810SUB810'.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPLSKBH' '0800',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' 'GT_FIELD_LIST-SELTEXT(01)',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=CONT',\n          ' ' 'BDC_SUBSCR' 'SAPLSKBH                                0810SUB810'.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPMSSY0' '0120',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' '04/03',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=PS 63'.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPMSSY0' '0120',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' '02/76',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=&IC1'.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPMSSY0' '0120',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' '02/76',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=&ILT'.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPLSSEL' '1104',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=CRET',\n          ' ' 'BDC_SUBSCR' 'SAPLSSEL                                1105%_SUBSCREEN_FREESEL',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' '%%DYN001-LOW',\n          ' ' '%%DYN001-LOW' gv_ssi_session_id.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPMSSY0' '0120',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' '04/15',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=&IC1'.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'RSM04000_ALV_NEW' '2000',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' gv_modus_string,\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=DEL'.\n      PERFORM bdcdaten USING:\n        'X' 'SAPMSSY0' '0120',\n          ' ' 'BDC_CURSOR' '04/15',\n          ' ' 'BDC_OKCODE' '=&F15'.\n      \" call transaction SM04, sync (S), no screens unless debugger (P)\n      CALL TRANSACTION 'SM04'\n              USING bdcdata\n              MODE 'P'\n              UPDATE 'S'.\n```\n\nIf you stick around the blog and or read other ABAP BDC posts of mine, you'll see for BDC I always use the following helper form `bdcdaten` that allows me to write the BDC so cleanly (as it is above):\n\n```abap\n*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*\n*&      Form  BDCDATEN\n*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*\nFORM bdcdaten USING start fnam fval.\n\n  CLEAR bdcdata.\n  IF start = 'X'.\n    bdcdata-dynbegin = start.\n    bdcdata-program  = fnam.\n    bdcdata-dynpro   = fval.\n  ELSE.\n    bdcdata-fnam = fnam.\n    bdcdata-fval = fval.\n  ENDIF.\n  APPEND bdcdata.\n\nENDFORM.                               \" BDCDATEN\n```\n\nThe only thing worth noting here is in our first step we always ensure the server view of `SM04` is active - we need to always run in server view, because we don't want all sessions across all servers. In this way, this report can run in parallel on all your servers and concern it self only with users logged on to the server instance that this report is running on. This will make the run time a bit faster, and of course splits up the search work across all servers.\n\n# Full Code\n\nThe full code of the report is as follows:\n\n```abap\nREPORT z_user_session_kill.\n*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*\n*& Report: Z_USER_SESSION_KILL                                         *\n*& Author: Christopher Frewin                                          *\n*& Creation Date: 2018.05.09                                           *\n*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*\n*&                                                                     *\n*&                                                                     *\n*&                                                         __          *\n*&                                           Christophe_r_|  |_F_rewin *\n*&                                                     |__    __|      *\n*&                                                        |  |         *\n*&                                \"Z_USER_SESSION_KILL\"   |  |         *\n*&                                                        |__|  17'    *\n*&---------------------------------------------------------------------*\n\n\" table needed for FOR in select-options statement\nTABLES: usr02.\n\n\" Data...  :)\nDATA: gv_time_dif_sperr   TYPE tims,\n      gv_tcode            TYPE eqetcode,\n      gv_aufnr            TYPE aufnr,\n      gv_message          TYPE sm04dic-popupmsg,\n      gv_objnr            TYPE j_objnr,\n      gv_stat             TYPE j_status,\n      gt_enq              TYPE TABLE OF seqg3,\n      gs_enq              LIKE LINE OF gt_enq,\n      server_info         TYPE REF TO cl_server_info,\n      gt_session_list     TYPE TABLE OF ssi_session_info,\n      gs_session_list     LIKE LINE OF gt_session_list,\n      gt_sessions_user    TYPE TABLE OF ssi_session_info,\n      gs_sessions_user    LIKE LINE OF gt_sessions_user,\n      bdcdata             LIKE bdcdata OCCURS 0 WITH HEADER LINE,\n      gv_modus_string     TYPE string,\n      gv_modus_index      TYPE string,\n      gv_user_name        TYPE eqeuname,\n      th_opcode(1)        TYPE x,\n      with_appl_info      TYPE ssi_bool VALUE 1,\n      gv_field(40),\n      gv_value(80),\n      gv_ssi_session_id   TYPE ssi_session_id,\n      gv_modus_num        TYPE ssi_session_hdl,\n      gv_modus_num_found  TYPE ssi_session_hdl,\n      gv_modus_index_char TYPE numc1,\n      gv_aufnr_string     TYPE string,\n      BEGIN OF gt_usr_info OCCURS 10,\n        field(40),\n        VALUE(80),\n      END OF gt_usr_info,\n      gs_usr_info LIKE LINE OF gt_usr_info,\n      gv_autyp    TYPE auftyp,\n      gv_uzeit    TYPE sy-uzeit,\n      gv_string   TYPE string.\n\n\" select option to exlude user\nSELECT-OPTIONS: so_bname FOR usr02-bname MEMORY ID xus NO INTERVALS.\n\nCONSTANTS: opcode_usr_info LIKE th_opcode VALUE 52. \" this is the internal SAP number used for the system function module 'ThUsrInfo'\ngv_uzeit = sy-uzeit. \" moved up here to have time before the enqueue_read function\n\n\" Get all AUFK table locks\nCALL FUNCTION 'ENQUEUE_READ'\n  EXPORTING\n    gname                 = 'AUFK'\n    guname                = '*'              \" Users (all)\n  TABLES\n    enq                   = gt_enq\n  EXCEPTIONS\n    communication_failure = 1\n    system_failure        = 2\n    OTHERS                = 3.\nIF sy-subrc <> 0.\n  EXIT.\nENDIF.\n\n\" Get all user sessions\nCREATE OBJECT server_info.\ngt_session_list = server_info->get_session_list( with_application_info = 1 ).\n\n\" Loop through each locked object (production orders)\nLOOP AT gt_enq INTO gs_enq.\n\n  \" Auftrag and Tcode for nice printing in the messages\n  gv_tcode = gs_enq-gtcode.\n  gv_aufnr_string = gs_enq-garg+3.\n  SHIFT gv_aufnr_string LEFT DELETING LEADING '0'.\n  CONDENSE gv_tcode.\n\n  \" We keep only the orders that have the status FREI ---> stat 'I0002' in table JEST\n  gv_aufnr = gs_enq-garg+3. \" GARG for aufnr is in the format '10000000XXXXXXX' therefore with +3 we should have the standard aufnr format 00000XXXXXXX (12 CHAR long)\n\n  \" Only orders with type 10 or 40 (production and proess orders)\n  CLEAR gv_autyp.\n  SELECT SINGLE autyp FROM aufk INTO gv_autyp\n    WHERE aufnr EQ gv_aufnr.\n  IF gv_autyp NE '10' AND gv_autyp NE '40'.\n    DELETE gt_enq INDEX sy-tabix. \" delete this line\n    CONTINUE. \" and go on to the next lock object in gt_enq\n  ENDIF.\n\n  \" Also check JEST table -
