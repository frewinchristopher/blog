That much I knew how to do - I had used custom command services with transaction SM69 before. The hard thing that I got stuck with: how could I, from our SAP application server, issue a specific command, on a specific server, to a specific service? Whew. Still with me? With help from one of our basic team members, we discovered that as it turns out, windows has a very nice command for exactly that.</p>\n<p>It’s called <code>sc</code>:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>C:\\>sc\nDESCRIPTION:\n        SC is a command line program used for communicating with the\n        Service Control Manager and services.\nUSAGE:\n        sc <server> [command] [service name] <option1> <option2>...\n\n\n        The option <server> has the form "\\\\ServerName"\n        Further help on commands can be obtained by typing: "sc [command]"\n        Commands:\n          query-----------Queries the status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          queryex---------Queries the extended status for a service, or enumerates the status for types of services.\n          start-----------Starts a service.\n          pause-----------Sends a PAUSE control request to a service.\n          interrogate-----Sends an INTERROGATE control request to a service.\n          continue--------Sends a CONTINUE control request to a service.\n          stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.\n          config----------Changes the configuration of a service (persistent).\n          description-----Changes the description of a service.\n          failure---------Changes the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          failureflag-----Changes the failure actions flag of a service.\n          sidtype---------Changes the service SID type of a service.\n          privs-----------Changes the required privileges of a service.\n          managedaccount--Changes the service to mark the service account password as managed by LSA.\n          qc--------------Queries the configuration information for a service.\n          qdescription----Queries the description for a service.\n          qfailure--------Queries the actions taken by a service upon failure.\n          qfailureflag----Queries the failure actions flag of a service.\n          qsidtype--------Queries the service SID type of a service.\n          qprivs----------Queries the required privileges of a service.\n          qtriggerinfo----Queries the trigger parameters of a service.\n          qpreferrednode--Queries the preferred NUMA node of a service.\n          qrunlevel-------Queries the run level of a service.\n          qmanagedaccount-Queries whether a services uses an account with a password managed by LSA.\n          qprotection-----Queries the process protection level of a service.\n          delete----------Deletes a service (from the registry).\n          create----------Creates a service.

[ y | n ]:</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Wow. That’s a monster of a command documentation. Let’s break down what we need.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The server. We know that (for this example, I’m going to just call it AWESOMESERVER01). But wait! There’s a gotchya, we will need to write it like:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>\\\\AWESOMESERVER01</code></p>\n<p>That’s not a special setting for server names that we have at my company or anything like that, that’s part of the <code>sc</code> command. Notice the line in the documentation that says exactly that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The option <server> has the form ”\\\\ServerName”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, now for our service name. Again, for instruction purposes of the command and for privacy sake, I’m going to call our service <code>ServiceName even with Whitespace</code>.</p>\n<p>Command? What command do we need? Let’s check out that wall of text documentation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>stop------------Sends a STOP request to a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, that sounds about as right as you can get. Oh also, hold your thoughts on this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commands:\n…\nstart-----------Starts a service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That will be useful later, too.</p>\n<p>Okay… Server name? Check. Service Name? Check. Command name(s)? Check. So, what do we get as a command for our efforts? It looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start "ServiceName even with Whitespace"</code></p>\n<p>So, in order for this to be a true <em>restart</em> of the service, we would have to issue a stop/start command pair on the service:</p>\n<p><code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 stop "ServiceName even with Whitespace"</code><br>\n<code>sc \\\\AWESOMESERVER01 start "ServiceName even with Whitespace"</code></p>\n<p>How do we do that in ABAP? Well, to run SM69 commands programmatically, we have the tasty function module <code>SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE</code>:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-abap"><code><span class="token keyword">CALL</span> <span class="token keyword">FUNCTION</span> <span class="token string">\'SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE\'</span>\n  <span class="token keyword">EXPORTING</span>\n    commandname                   <span class="token operator">=</span> gv_commandname\n    additional_parameters         <span class="token operator">=</span> gv_additional_parameters\n    operatingsystem               <span class="token operator">=</span> gv_operatingsystem\n  <span class="token keyword">TABLES</span>\n    exec_protocol                 <span class="token operator">=</span> gt_result\n  <span class="token keyword">EXCEPTIONS</span>\n    no_permission                 <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">1</span>\n    command_not_found             <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">2</span>\n    parameters_too_long           <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">3</span>\n    security_risk                 <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">4</span>\n    wrong_check_call_interface    <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">5</span>\n    program_start_error           <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">6</span>\n    program_termination_error     <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">7</span>\n    x_error                       <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">8</span>\n    parameter_expected            <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">9</span>\n    too_many_parameters           <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">10</span>\n    illegal_command               <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">11</span>\n    wrong_asynchronous_parameters <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">12</span>\n    cant_enq_tbtco_entry          <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">13</span>\n    jobcount_generation_error     <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">14</span>\n    <span class="token keyword">OTHERS</span>                        <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">15</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p><em>Intellectual property disclaimer: the exact source code and use case have been modified from the real use case at the company I work for, <a href="https://www.ospelt.com/en/ospelt/info/home.html">Ospelt</a>.</em></p>',frontmatter:{title:"Sending Windows Server Commands From SAP ABAP",date:"December 12, 2017"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/sending-windows-commands-from-sap-abap/"}}}});
