(I wanted a weird mishmash of stickers for my development interests - spanning from perl to raiblocks to solidity - I know, weird) You can snag the same exact sticker sheet (I found the ‚Äòmedium‚Äô sized sheet to produce the stickers with the best size for a laptop) <a href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/people/chrisfrewin/works/30313316-dev-stickers?p=sticker&#x26;size=small&#x26;size=medium\">https://www.redbubble.com/people/chrisfrewin/works/30313316-dev-stickers?p=sticker&#x26;size=small&#x26;size=medium</a> *Disclaimer: that is indeed my product on RedBubble!</em></p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs how my mac looks now:</p>\n<p><img src=\"./laptopstickers2.jpg\" alt=\"Much cool.
