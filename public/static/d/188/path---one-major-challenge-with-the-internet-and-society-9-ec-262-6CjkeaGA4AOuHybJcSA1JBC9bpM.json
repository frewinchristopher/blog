However, while it gives me more hope personally, I think this post is still extremely relevant!</i><sup></p>\n<h2>Ads, Companies, Creators, Makers, the Network Effect, and Redistribution</h2>\n<p>This post is going to be about the culture around payments, donations, and transactions in general online - and what could be a revolution and explosion in creativity.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve been mulling over this thread of thought for months now. After enough rumination, I‚Äôve finally been able to pull it all together into this fairly large post. I‚Äôve collected a variety of fairly recent sources that convey the fact that these issues have been trending for a while and are coming to a point in the digital economy. </p>\n<p>I start off with what is going on with creators or creative entities - whether companies or individual Makers (all credit to <a href=\"https://producthunt.com\">Product Hunt</a> for that term üòâ), and then shifting to how everything appears to everyone on the other side so to speak, i.e. consumers in 2018, 2019, and 2020. I finish with prescribed solution(s) to the problem, and things that I am continuing to consider, even after distilling my thoughts into this post.</p>\n<p>This is a longer, non-dev post of mine, but I think these are very important issues that need to be discussed more often. So grab a ‚òï and put your thinking cap on!</p>\n<h2>Advertisements and the Network Effect Perspective of Companies, Creators and Makers</h2>\n<h3>The Network Effect</h3>\n<p>A very important paper that was one of the first items that got me thinking along the lines of these issues is this paper about the role of luck. While it is aimed at single individuals, if a company or organization is considered as an individual in the market, many of the same findings and principles can apply.</p>\n<p>So the paper found that counterintuitively that people of only average intellegince . Unfortunately, most intelligent (or even most hard working!) were not those who were most succesful (granted, there was a skew of more intellegent people to do better on average, but overwhelmingly they were not the <em>most</em> successful)</p>\n<p>Since the researches had of course total control over the experiment,  as the second half of hte paper, the examined what if the economic insentives were changed in . they tested a few capabilities:</p>\n<h2>-</h2>\n<p>-</p>\n<p> <em>This redistribution is exactly the issue I am going to get at in this post</em></p>\n<p>But wait you say, ‚Äúthe internet is by definition a giant sharing and redistribution network!‚Äù Indeed, but let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs the sharing and redistribution of <em>information</em>, not money or wealth. I beleive these two things, information and money, are impertive to reorganize the motives of creatives and </p>\n<h3>The Subscription Based Web</h3>\n<p>To understand why redistribution hasn‚Äôt been monetary based and only information based, we have to look at the companies that define huge percentages of the internet right now. </p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs look at a concrete example by way of monthly subscription style services I‚Äôve been thinking of subscribing to, but haven‚Äôt because I‚Äôm too much of a cheapo:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$4 / mo. New Yorker Subscription (‚Äújust‚Äù $1 a week as their add states!!! üòë )</li>\n<li>$5 / mo. Medium membership (yeah, the free version is not enough for me - I read a lot of people‚Äôs stuff)</li>\n<li>$6.67 / mo. The Economist (subscription itself is 12 weeks = 3 months, for $20)</li>\n<li>$5.99 / mo. Reddit Premium</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So‚Ä¶ that adds up to nearly $16 a month, or $192 a year! $192 gone, just for four subscriptions, and this is a conservative list - these are just the subscriptions that I‚Äôm toying with / have to deal with working around.</p>\n<p>As I I‚Äôm currently debating if I myself should subscribe to these services (see? I too am a self prophesizing problem of this issue!)</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt argue that $1 a month or even $5 a month is too much for a single service. I guess what I‚Äôm trying to argue is that these profits go to big companies that can then recycle their revenue into more advertising or better development etc. This is exactly the network effect at work. Then these companies grow, and, if they go public, in order to grow their numbers to make Wall Street happy, they have to resort to one thing to keep growth metrics alive:</p>\n<p><strong>They use ads!</strong></p>\n<h3>The Ad-Death of the Modern Social Network Company</h3>\n<p><sup>See: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe\">The heat death of the universe</a></sup></p>\n<p>A joke I tell is picturing the end result of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and the like, will be only a constant stream of - not of what is going on with your family and friends‚Äô life - but of ads!</p>\n<p>But then what? We‚Äôve seen what happens as soon as Wall Street even gets wind of a decrease in earnings in the future. </p>\n<h3>Hope for Non-commercial Social Networks</h3>\n<p>What encourages me is what I‚Äôve seen through <a href=\"https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com\">Hacktoberfest</a>, in that groups of passionate developers (the <a href=\"https://dev.to\">DEV community</a> is a great example) are already toying with ways of creating</p>\n<p>In these types of Social Web 3.0 as I‚Äôd like to call it, the ads on those sites are a means to end: they keep the service running. In this case, the model is that members of the network come first, whereas (nowadays on Twitter and Facebook), it seems like the opposite is true: the user is bombarded with ads that, while it may indeed be targeted to the their interests, is nonetheless approaching spam levels. Advertisers first, users second.</p>\n<p>Another hope is that the new generation Y is more charitably and socially aware than any generation that has come before them. They are looking now, not just for companies and individuals that donate profits for example, but actively participate. I suppose from a Maker perspective, these are people who are actively contributing to online communities, podcasts, and blog posts, sharing their ideas and putting in the <a href=\"https://seths.blog/2014/07/doing-the-hard-things/\">hard work</a> to stand out in the digital age. Or, like DEV - not a bombardment of scrolling through ads - just good and solid ones that keep the company running!</p>\n<h2>The Consumer‚Äôs Perspective</h2>\n<p>The current outlook of those who are supposed to support the digital marketplace - the consumer at large - is just as grim. Facebook is a prime example. I haven‚Äôt used Facebook for three years now, but I‚Äôve looked over the shoulder of my buddy when we were hanging out this summer, checking out his feed on his facebook, and immediately exclaimed, astounded: ‚ÄúWhat the hell happened?! It‚Äôs all ads!‚Äù </p>\n<p>My buddy, sounding jaded and already much used to this deluge, replied ‚ÄúYep, Facebook is just all ads now, dude.‚Äù. </p>\n<p>My brother, graduating with his bachelor‚Äôs degree this year (so just inside the start generation Y), says that he and his friends use facebook only mostly for events now, also because of this √ºber ad attack reason.</p>\n<p>Another Maker, Justin Jackson brings up another brilliant point <a href=\"\">in this podcast episode</a> is that with all these ads, the user is overwhelmed, and in Justin‚Äôs words ‚Äòexhausted‚Äô from the constant bombardment of the next big thing. It‚Äôs training many consumers to simply ignore all those ads they constantly have to scroll through, regardless of if the product itself could perhaps deserve a look or two.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs true: while the consumer these days is empowered with making, this requires that products be very useful, very unique, and with stories behind them. Printing some text on a t-shirt isn‚Äôt going to cut it in this next generation of the economy.</p>\n<h2>The Solution(s)</h2>\n<p>However, what if we thought of the next generation cash flow like this: What if (I‚Äôve checked multiple blogs that posted, for example, a Bitcoin or Ethereum address - they all have 0 transactions)</p>\n<p>Such a model could be applied to anything.</p>\n<p>There were groups trying to build such microtransaction systems (yes, even before crypto currency):</p>\n<p>But this project seems to have died out.</p>\n<h3>The dawn of the redistribution company</h3>\n<p>There‚Äôs another neat way to solve this. Let‚Äôs make an example: </p>\n<p>Chris sells widgets. Each widget Chris sells would normally provide him with $10 in profit. But what if Chris redistributes the profits from every widget sold to anyone who has every bought the widget - including Chris himself! Of course the profits I realize will become marginally smaller the more people that buy my ‚Äòwidget‚Äô‚Ä¶ so, is this the very definition of a pyramid scheme? I don‚Äôt think so, because I‚Äôm distrubiting everything equally. The only problem is still the issue of early adopters - they will benefit financially the most, while some of the people to purchase the product last.  To some this may sound eerily ‚Äòcommunist‚Äô. </p>\n<p>But isn‚Äôt the alternative worse? A group of companies reaping a massive amount of the internet‚Äôs wealth (Okay, to be fair, according to Bruce Upbin at Forbes and three systems theorists from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2011/10/22/the-147-companies-that-control-everything/#1f58903f5105\">40% of the wealth is controlled by 147 companies, and 80% if controlled by 737</a>. Meanwhile, 10 companies control 80% of the media.</p>\n<p>Anyway, lets do the math on such a scenario. I think its a bit weird to immediately get the refund back from your purchase, so lets consider the redistribution at the end of certain time frame - say a year or six months.</p>\n<p>Still, this has the same structure as a corporate structure, also showing similiar effects like the cryptocurrency phase, in that early adopters benefitted. It all goes back to this luck paper. That lucky individuals , while only more lucky on a linear scale, reflect wealth results that scale in the geometric range. </p>\n<p>Still, I think this method is in the right direction of creative and Maker wealth redistribution in my dream of a ‚Äònew economy‚Äô.</p>\n<p>You‚Äôre probably thinking at this point, ‚Äúthis guy is crazy; I‚Äôm not going to read his blog anymore‚Äù. Good ma‚Äôam or sir, I laugh at you! No, to me, the prospect of having a huge economy where experts of all shapes and sizes can thrive based off donations and commission work is the ideal. Perhaps this ideal . Indeed, the Maker movement, Digital Nomads, the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianrashid/2016/01/26/the-rise-of-the-freelancer-economy/#5512d2693bdf\">exploding size of the freelance workforce</a> are all sounding </p>\n<p>Additionally, as I‚Äôve frequently stated, being a software developer who is interested and always willing to learn in 2018, I will never be short of having a ‚Äòjob that pays the bills‚Äô, although the vision in this post is to create an economy where that wont be needed anyway. üòâ</p>\n<h2>My Pledge</h2>\n<p>Posting this giant post with all talk and no action would be pretty lame. Therefore, as of today 90% of all donations to this blog will be recycled into the maker and creative economy of awesome things out there that I deem valid to support. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sam Harris‚Äôs Waking Up Podcast</li>\n<li>Dan Carlin‚Äôs Hardcore History (Which he made free and by volunteer donation only - excellent!)</li>\n<li>The GatsbyJS Team - fantastic work they are doing - also and example of the full tool which is totally free and donations are optional</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-text\">create-react-app</code> Team - another invaluable tool for developers like me who use React JS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I‚Äôm building out a page to track these recycled cash flows. I‚Äôm paying it forward in hopes to speed up my dream of a Maker, Consultant, and Creative economy a reality.</p>\n<h2>Future Considerations and More Work</h2>\n<p>This is an issue that I repeatedly think about, and will likely blog again.</p>\n<p>As I build out my arsenal of projects as a Maker (all credit to (<a href=\"https://producthunt.com\">https://producthunt.com</a>)[Product Hunt] for that term), I think I will be opting for the one time charge - or in the worst case, a yearly subscription. </p>\n<p>A common complaint by software engineers is that they don‚Äôt work on projects that are challenging and ground breaking, or for companies that by nature aren‚Äôt pushing the cutting edge. This issue was discussed in depth in a Hacker News thread.</p>\n<p>That the very nature of the network effect is a root cause of this issue. </p>\n<p>If we want smart people to have the freedom and security to work freely on large scale ‚Äòmoonshot‚Äô projects (regardless of discipline - this applies to the arts, sciences, engineering, software - you name it) we <em>have</em> to be more open to supporting creators. I picture a world of networked freelancers all striving, while also volunteering time to contribute to open source versions of the things that we use Perhaps I‚Äôm missing something that isn‚Äôt feasible, but to me, its the solution of all the problems raised in this post.</p>\n<h2>Further Reading</h2>\n<p>Here are some other high quality pieces I think are worth reading, but couldn‚Äôt find a way to incorporate them smoothly into this post:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html\">Wait but Why - How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You)</a></p>\n<p>Cheers! üç∫</p>\n<p>Chris</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Internet, Subscriptions, Big Winners, the Networking Effect, Makers & Creators, and Society Today","date":"October 19, 2018","draft":true,"starID":55}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/one-major-challenge-with-the-internet-and-society/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/laptop-stickers/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"19 December, 2017","title":"My Laptop Stickers Arrived!
