(What other time of year do you have 4+ hours to spend duking it out with one of the worldâ€™s most loved<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\">1</a></sup> games?)</p>\n<p>So, anyway, my brother had snagged both the purples (Mediterranean and Baltic) and the light blues (, and Connecticut) . When a player owns both of these adjacent monopolies, we cherishingly call that player the â€˜slum lordâ€™). My girlfriend ended up with the greens and blues, what we call the â€˜high rollerâ€™ properties. I of course, thought she had the better advantage of winning. But as the game went on, we realized just how high maintenence (the properties, not my girlfriend ðŸ˜‚) those expensive are. First, they cost a fortune to buy, and at $200 dollars per house. In addition, Boardwalk and Park Place have the added fact that they are only a 2 property set.</p>\n<p>In the end, my girlfriend was one of the first players to go out, while my brother lasted as 2nd place in the game (I actually ended up winning due to massive luck with the purple properties (Virginia, States, and St. Charles Place))</p>\n<p>So, now the question: was our intuition with higher or lower prof? Or is it true that some properties and property groups have an inherently better profit margin?</p>\n<p>Turns out, it couldnâ€™t be more true!</p>\n<h2>The Data</h2>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Tabulated Card Data (I redacted the English (?) titles in the name) <a href=\"http://www.falstad.com/monopoly.html\">http://www.falstad.com/monopoly.html</a></li>\n<li>Converting HTML <table> tag to CSV with <a href=\"http://convertcsv.com/html-table-to-csv.htm\">http://convertcsv.com/html-table-to-csv.htm</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Further Reading</h2>\n<p>Truman Collins already did a massive probability analysis of monopoly in his blog in 2005. <a href=\"http://www.tkcs-collins.com/truman/monopoly/monopoly.shtml#Markov\">You can find that blog post here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Footnotes</h2>\n<div id=\"footnote-1\">\n[1.
