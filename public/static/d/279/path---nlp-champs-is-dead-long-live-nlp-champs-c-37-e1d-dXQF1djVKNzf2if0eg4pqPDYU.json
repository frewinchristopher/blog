Likewise, my interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) peaked while I was on my machine learning bender in general - and I found the NLP algorithms most interesting, and deeply challenging. It seems to me that there are <em>so many</em> visual identification algorithms floating around out there, but somehow language processing algorithms seem to be lacking. </p>\n<p>I think that‚Äôs clear - not just in cutting edge research - but in industry as well - we all know too well that talking / listening ‚ÄòAIs‚Äô like Siri or Alexa are <em>still</em> not rock solid and get a lot of things wrong many times - and that‚Äôs even when speaking very clearly! </p>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 59.42622950819671%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Dammit Siri!
