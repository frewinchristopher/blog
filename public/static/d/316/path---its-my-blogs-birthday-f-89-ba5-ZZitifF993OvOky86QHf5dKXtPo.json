So to see that ‘Hello World’ post, you’ll need to click either the ‘all’ or ‘blog’ tag, and scroll all the way down.</p>\n<p>Anyway, as a celebration, I built out a stats page for the blog, found at <a href=\"https://chrisfrew.in/stats\">https://chrisfrew.in/stats</a>. (There will also now be a permanent blog ) This will be a data dump of blog posts per year, both from Gatsby GraphQL queries, and a postgresql database (which keeps track of all those nice ⭐stars⭐ you’ve all been giving me!). For now, this page will just have blog posts per month, stars per post, and similar. We’ll see if I can get more creative ideas with it in the future.</p>\n<p>Thats all for now!</p>\n<p>Cheers! 🍺</p>\n<p>-Chris</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"It's My Blog's Birthday!","date":"December 12, 2018","draft":false,"starID":102,"postType":"blog"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/its-my-blogs-birthday/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/i-set-aside-1000-to-learn-options-trading/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"07 April, 2018","title":"I Set Aside $1000 to Learn Options Trading","draft":false,"starID":14,"postType":"misc","link":"https://chrisfrew.in/i-set-aside-1000-to-learn-options-trading/","relativeLink":"/i-set-aside-1000-to-learn-options-trading/"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/jump-from-SAPUI5-to-transactions-in-web-gui-with-batch-input/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"25 January, 2018","title":"Jump from SAPUI5 Apps to Transactions in Web GUI with Batch Input","draft":true,"starID":33,"postType":"dev"}}}}
