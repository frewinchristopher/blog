Indeed, seeing as , this would be of interest. I was surprised to find that there was no strong - except for one peculiarity. In 2015, over the last week of May and the first week of June, someone or (something) <em>registered nearly all the remaining 3 letter usernames left on reddit!</em> Even more scary is the number of accounts that have a verified email</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">False    12277\nTrue        26</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>So, of those 12000+ users that were registered in those two weeks, <em>only 26 of them have a registered email!</em></p>\n<p>As an interesting side note, this spike of user registration missed a few usernames, 8 to be exact (likely users had trouble finding these remaining):</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">name      created_utc_date\nuzi       2016-03-16\ntnw       2017-08-07\nvox       2017-08-24\nwsj       2017-11-14\nkfc       2018-02-06\nnbc       2018-03-06\nnpr       2018-03-06\nmls       2018-03-27</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Interestingly, while the majority of these are alliterations for big organzations, only <code class=\"language-text\">vox</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">npr</code> appear to be used. <code class=\"language-text\">uzi</code> has quite a bit of karma, but appears to be a normal user, while all remaining have only their email verified and their initial single link karma.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Data Challenge!
