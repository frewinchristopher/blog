(hint - itâ€™s the <a href=\"https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality\">INTJ</a> way). Likewise, my interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP) peaked while I was on my machine learning bender in general - and I found the NLP parts most interesting, and still most incomplete. There are so many visual identification algorithms, but somehow language processing algorithms seem to be lacking. My NLP interests also stemmed a bit from the fact that talking / listening AIs like Siri or Alexa are <em>still</em> not rock solid and get a lot of things wrong many times - and thatâ€™s even when speaking very clearly! </p>\n<h2>In Any Event</h2>\n<p>The knowledge I gained was useful, and I may even bring it into something I create in the future. Frankly, I just need to get away a bit more from my current project and get back to slowing down and tinkering, putting interesting stuff together. Looking back at some of the posts and code I madeâ€¦ I really there was some neat stuff!</p>\n<p>However, since I havenâ€™t bothered to check our Google Analytics (actually, I donâ€™t even know if we have one for nlp-champs.com), our Gmail account, or really anything NLP Champs related to the site forâ€¦<sup><sup>hmmmmmmmmm</sup></sup>, about half a year now, its time to abandon it. (It also has largely to do with the fact that Iâ€™m a cheap ass and donâ€™t want to renew the domain ðŸ˜‚)</p>\n<p>Stillâ€¦ Iâ€™ll always be fond of that gold and black design. :+1:</p>\n<p>And who knows - it could always be revived, and I may even post there from time to time.
