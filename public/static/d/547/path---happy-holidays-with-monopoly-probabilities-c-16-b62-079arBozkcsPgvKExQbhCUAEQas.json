(What other time of year do you have 4+ hours to spend duking it out with one of the world‚Äôs most loved<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\">1</a></sup> games?)</p>\n<p>So, anyway, my brother had snagged both the purples (Mediterranean and Baltic) and the light blues (, and Connecticut) . When a player owns both of these adjacent monopolies, we cherishingly call that player the ‚Äòslum lord‚Äô). My girlfriend ended up with the greens and blues, what we call the ‚Äòhigh roller‚Äô properties. I of course, thought she had the better advantage of winning. But as the game went on, we realized just how high maintenance (the properties, not my girlfriend üòÇ) those expensive are. First, they cost a fortune to buy, and at $200 dollars per house. In addition, Boardwalk and Park Place have the added fact that they are only a 2 property set.</p>\n<p>In the end, my girlfriend was one of the first players to go out, while my brother lasted as 2nd place in the game (I actually ended up winning due to massive luck with the purple properties (Virginia, States, and St. Charles Place))</p>\n<p>So, now the question: was our intuition with higher or lower prof? Or is it true that some properties and property groups have an inherently better profit margin?</p>\n<p>Turns out, it couldn‚Äôt be more true!</p>\n<h2>Raw Return</h2>\n<p>I calculated the total price per property plus the cost of building to hotel vs. the payout of a hotel at that given property, for all rent-based properties in the game:</p>\n<style>\n\n.axis .domain {\n  display: none;\n}\n\n</style>\n<p><svg width=\"960\" height=\"500\"></svg></p>\n<script src=\"https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n\nvar svg = d3.select(\"svg\"),\n    margin = {top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 30, left: 40},\n    width = +svg.attr(\"width\") - margin.left - margin.right,\n    height = +svg.attr(\"height\") - margin.top - margin.bottom,\n    g = svg.append(\"g\").attr(\"transform\", \"translate(\" + margin.left + \",\" + margin.top + \")\");\n\nvar x0 = d3.scaleBand()\n    .rangeRound([0, width])\n    .paddingInner(0.1);\n\nvar x1 = d3.scaleBand()\n    .padding(0.05);\n\nvar y = d3.scaleLinear()\n    .rangeRound([height, 0]);\n\nvar z = d3.scaleOrdinal()\n    .range([\"#98abc5\", \"#8a89a6\", \"#7b6888\"]);\n\nd3.csv(\"./data.csv\", function(d, i, columns) {\n  for (var i = 1, n = columns.length; i < n; ++i) d[columns[i]] = +d[columns[i]];\n  return d;\n}, function(error, data) {\n  if (error) throw error;\n\n  var keys = data.columns.slice(1);\n\n  x0.domain(data.map(function(d) { return d.State; }));\n  x1.domain(keys).rangeRound([0, x0.bandwidth()]);\n  y.domain([0, d3.max(data, function(d) { return d3.max(keys, function(key) { return d[key]; }); })]).nice();\n\n  g.append(\"g\")\n    .selectAll(\"g\")\n    .data(data)\n    .enter().append(\"g\")\n      .attr(\"transform\", function(d) { return \"translate(\" + x0(d.State) + \",0)\"; })\n    .selectAll(\"rect\")\n    .data(function(d) { return keys.map(function(key) { return {key: key, value: d[key]}; }); })\n    .enter().append(\"rect\")\n      .attr(\"x\", function(d) { return x1(d.key); })\n      .attr(\"y\", function(d) { return y(d.value); })\n      .attr(\"width\", x1.bandwidth())\n      .attr(\"height\", function(d) { return height - y(d.value); })\n      .attr(\"fill\", function(d) { return z(d.key); });\n\n  g.append(\"g\")\n      .attr(\"class\", \"axis\")\n      .attr(\"transform\", \"translate(0,\" + height + \")\")\n      .call(d3.axisBottom(x0));\n\n  g.append(\"g\")\n      .attr(\"class\", \"axis\")\n      .call(d3.axisLeft(y).ticks(null, \"s\"))\n    .append(\"text\")\n      .attr(\"x\", 2)\n      .attr(\"y\", y(y.ticks().pop()) + 0.5)\n      .attr(\"dy\", \"0.32em\")\n      .attr(\"fill\", \"#000\")\n      .attr(\"font-weight\", \"bold\")\n      .attr(\"text-anchor\", \"start\")\n      .text(\"Population\");\n\n  var legend = g.append(\"g\")\n      .attr(\"font-family\", \"sans-serif\")\n      .attr(\"font-size\", 10)\n      .attr(\"text-anchor\", \"end\")\n    .selectAll(\"g\")\n    .data(keys.slice().reverse())\n    .enter().append(\"g\")\n      .attr(\"transform\", function(d, i) { return \"translate(0,\" + i * 20 + \")\"; });\n\n  legend.append(\"rect\")\n      .attr(\"x\", width - 19)\n      .attr(\"width\", 19)\n      .attr(\"height\", 19)\n      .attr(\"fill\", z);\n\n  legend.append(\"text\")\n      .attr(\"x\", width - 24)\n      .attr(\"y\", 9.5)\n      .attr(\"dy\", \"0.32em\")\n      .text(function(d) { return d; });\n});\n\n</script>\n<p>This analysis of the expected return on a property show us that the light blue properties are the best investment in terms of expected return.
