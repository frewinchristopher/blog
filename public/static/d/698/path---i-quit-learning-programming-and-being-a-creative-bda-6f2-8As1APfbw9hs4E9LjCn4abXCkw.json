All this extra learning with programming, learning how to make screen prints (), making iOS apps, fiddling with options, learning new programming languages and paradigms, it’s all a waste of time! It’s just too much effort, and what do I get? Self satisfaction? More job opportunities? A daily challenge? I <em>hate</em> all those things!</p>\n<p>I’m just gonna get my snug 40 hour a week job, and call it a day. No more development, just build a house and work that 9-5 for the rest of my days. You win life. I’m out.</p>\n<p>In light of this lifestyle change,</p>\n<p><strong><em>I won’t be making any more Skillshare videos, any more art prints, or programming a single line ever again.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Sorry if I’ve offended you, but there’s even better news:</p>\n<p>this is an April fool’s post. 😂</p>\n<p>Oh, it’s also my birthday (NOT an april fools joke = trust me I’ve heard that one just a few times 😉). </p>\n<p>I’m 27. And old. 💀</p>\n<p>🍺 Cheers!</p>\n<p>-Chris</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I quit learning, writing, and being a creative.","date":"April 01, 2019","draft":false,"starID":501,"postType":"life"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/i-quit-learning-programming-and-being-a-creative/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/using-a-fluent-interface-to-ease-the-pain-of-soap-calls/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"27 February, 2019","title":"Using a Fluent Interface to Ease The Pain of SOAP Calls","draft":true,"starID":500,"postType":"dev","link":"https://chrisfrew.in/using-a-fluent-interface-to-ease-the-pain-of-soap-calls/","relativeLink":"/using-a-fluent-interface-to-ease-the-pain-of-soap-calls/"}},"next":null}}
