So to see that ‚ÄòHello World‚Äô post, you‚Äôll need to click either the ‚Äòall‚Äô or ‚Äòblog‚Äô tag, and scroll all the way down.</p>\n<p>Anyway, as a celebration, I built out a stats page for the blog, found at <a href=\"https://chrisfrew.in/stats\">https://chrisfrew.in/stats</a>. (There will also now be a permanent blog ) This will be a data dump of blog posts per year, both from Gatsby GraphQL queries, and a postgresql database (which keeps track of all those nice ‚≠êstars‚≠ê you‚Äôve all been giving me!). For now, this page will just have blog posts per month, stars per post, and similar. We‚Äôll see if I can get more creative ideas with it in the future.</p>\n<p>Thats all for now!</p>\n<p>Cheers! üç∫</p>\n<p>-Chris</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"It's My Blog's Birthday!","date":"December 12, 2018","draft":false,"starID":102,"postType":"blog"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/its-my-blogs-birthday/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/introducing-chrisfrewin-productions/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"01 March, 2018","title":"Introducing my (new / same?!) company chrisfrew.in!
