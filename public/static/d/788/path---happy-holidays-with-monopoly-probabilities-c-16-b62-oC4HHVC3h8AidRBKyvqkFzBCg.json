(What other time of year do you have 4+ hours to spend duking it out with one of the world’s most loved<sup><a href=\"#footnote-1\">1</a></sup> games?)</p>\n<p>So, in a recent bout, my brother had snagged both the brown / dark purple properties (Mediterranean and Baltic) as well as the light blues (Oriental, Vermont, and Connecticut). If a player owns both of these adjacent monopolies, we cherishingly call them the ‘slum lord’). </p>\n<p>My girlfriend ended up with the greens and blues, what we call the ‘high roller’ properties. I initially thought she had the better advantage of winning. But as the game went on, we realized just how high maintenance (the properties, not my girlfriend 😂) those expensive green and blue properties are. First, they cost a fortune to buy, and at $200 dollars per house, cost an even bigger fortune to build on. There’s the additional detriment that Boardwalk and Park Place are only a two property set.</p>\n<p>In the end, my girlfriend was actually one of the first players to go out, while my brother lasted as 2nd place in the game (I actually ended up winning due to massive luck with the magenta properties - Virginia, States, and St. Charles Place))</p>\n<p>So, now the question: was our intuition with higher or lower prof? Or is it true that some properties and property groups have an inherently better profit margin?</p>\n<p>Turns out, it couldn’t be more true!</p>\n<h2>Raw Return</h2>\n<p>I calculated the percent return on investment (ROI) as follows: </p>\n<span class=\"katex-display\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>b</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">a^2 + b^2 = c^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.9474379999999999em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">a</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8641079999999999em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.113em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">+</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8641079999999999em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">b</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8641079999999999em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.113em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8641079999999999em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">c</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8641079999999999em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.113em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n<span class=\"katex-display\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">%ROI = \\\\frac{(total price per property + the cost of building to hotel)}{rent cost of property with hotel} \\times 100</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></span></span>\n<p>I calculated and plotted the ROI for 1,2, and 3 ‘lands’ on a property:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/chart-f2e620d54752b70e15977879a370f9a8.svg\" alt=\"Chart of ROI values per rent-style property\"></p>\n<p>(Sorry for the non-interactive .svg, Gatsby 2.0 currently has no way of including bar charts easily - trust me, I spend a few hours trying t o.

However, it’s not a complete picture of the game. we need to consider locations on the board to complete our analysis.</p>\n<h2>Spatial Considerations</h2>\n<p>First, a large location sink in the game is the jail. All Chance and Community Chest spaces have a small chance of sending you there, and then of course the Go To Jail space will send you there. So let’s look at the roll probabilities from the jail space to </p>\n<p>Note the roll probability of two dice:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Roll</td>\n<td>2 dice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1/36 (2.778%)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2/36 (5.556%)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3/36 (8.333%)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4/36 (11.111%)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5/36 (13.889%)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>6/36 (16.667%)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5/36 (13.889%)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>4/36 (11.111%)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>3/36 (8.333%)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>2/36 (5.556%)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>1/36 (2.778%)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Yes, landing on Community Chest from jail is actually the most likely with a roll of 7 at 16.667% from a two sided dice roll, but Tennessee, St. James, and New York Avenue all are close in neighbouring probabilities at 13.889%, 13.889%, and 11.111%, respectively, for an overwhelming net of 38.889% chance of a landing on an orange property from a single role from jail.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>From both this analysis and being a huge Monopoly nerd as a kid, we can draw a few conclusions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seek first the orange properties (as the nearly unanimously accepted best property by more people other than just me) </li>\n<li>Seek second the light blues (from a pure return on investment perspective) </li>\n<li>Seek then any of the (in that order, based on)</li>\n<li>Don’t bother with the greens or blues in the early game - I often let them be auctioned off myself. Many a time I see players nearly bankrupting themselves in the early game to buy and build houses on these properties, only to get knocked off, albiet by more modest rents, still significant in size from the light blues, magenta , oranges, red, and yellows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, in summary:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Orange properties</li>\n<li>Light blues properties</li>\n<li>Magenta properties (or light purple / pink if you prefer, AKA the ones next to the orange properties)</li>\n<li>Yellow properties</li>\n<li>Red properties</li>\n<li>Blue properties</li>\n<li>Green properties</li>\n<li>Brown properties (dark purple if you prefer?)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, Monopoly is a game still highly based on chance, and results and mileage explained here will vary. However, by subscribing to these general ideas, I’ve had great success so far this holiday season. Good luck if you’re playing any time over the holidays!</p>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Tabulated Card Data (I redacted the UK version titles in the names on my own chart, keeping only the US versions): <a href=\"http://www.falstad.com/monopoly.html\">http://www.falstad.com/monopoly.html</a></li>\n<li>Converting HTML <table> tag to CSV with: <a href=\"http://convertcsv.com/html-table-to-csv.htm\">http://convertcsv.com/html-table-to-csv.htm</a></li>\n<li>Probabilities for 6 sided dice: <a href=\"http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~leif/FRP/probability.html\">http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~leif/FRP/probability.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Further References and Reading</h2>\n<p>Truman Collins already did <a href=\"http://www.tkcs-collins.com/truman/monopoly/monopoly.shtml#Markov\">a massive probability analysis of Monopoly in his blog in 2005.</a>.</p>\n<p>Jim Slater, the famous English bank businessman, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdQ3ztGk0D4&#x26;t=57m38s\">provides a breakdown of the expected returns of some of the monopolies (and independently matches what was found by me, I’ll be proud to admit! 😄) in the fourth episode of “The Mayfair Set” documentaries by Adam Curtis</a>, (though in the video he is referring to the English names of the properties - helpful that he still mentions the colors 😂).</p>\n<h2>Footnotes</h2>\n<div id=\"footnote-1\">\n1.
