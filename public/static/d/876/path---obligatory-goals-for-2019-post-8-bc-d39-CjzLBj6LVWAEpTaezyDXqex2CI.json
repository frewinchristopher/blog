I find that making goals works best for me, as they are more concrete than resolutions, which our friends at google state, is â€˜a firm decision to do or not to do somethingâ€™. Resolutions are something</p>\n<p>Okay, enough with the New Yearâ€™s philosophy alreadyâ€¦ ðŸ™„</p>\n<p>Anyway, this year should be exciting, as Iâ€™m not bound to a fixed location of work for 42.5 hours a week. With that said, Iâ€™ll still be using the traditional 40 hours a week to develop my skills and continue building projects.</p>\n<h2>Goals for 2019</h2>\n<p>Iâ€™ve divided my goals into directly career oriented goals and miscellaneous (mostly hobby and )</p>\n<h3>Software Engineering and Career Goals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn Typescript and incorporate it into personal stack (as a first challenge)</li>\n<li>Find a paying freelance employer or project (in addition to what looks like a 60-80% time fixed contract for 2019. I should have the time for this)</li>\n<li>Finally make a profitable side hustle! (Iâ€™m not sure if it will be software product or different products entirely, or another shot at an e-commerce store. I suppose since itâ€™s a fresh start this year, I have to be honest with myself about <a href=\"https://sirenapparel.us\">Siren Apparel</a>. The bottom line is that nobody visits the site! Iâ€™m going to deactivate our Shopify subscription this month and leave up the website as a boutique made-to-order store.)</li>\n<li>Earn at least $1000 through my Skillshare course(s) (If itâ€™s more obviously I will be very happy!)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Miscellaneous Goals</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Read more (I even made a <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/8863-2019-reading-challenge\">â€˜read 30 booksâ€™ goal on goodreads.com</a> - Iâ€™ll aim for that first, but honestly it should be even more for all of 2019. I think this year I will start properly keeping track of my books on goodreads.com as well.)</li>\n<li>Paint more (I made a few number of acrylic and watercolor pieces in 2017, but 2018 was a very slow year in terms of physical art. I published much more digital art in 2018](<a href=\"https://instagram.com/chris_creates_art\">https://instagram.com/chris<em>creates</em>art</a>).)</li>\n<li>Record and publish at least 2 songs (Acquiring the bare minimum for a home studio was also new for me in 2018, at least in the last half of the year. Iâ€™m learning just how hard recording with a professional microphone is. It will take practice and some good song writing, but I am confident to release a few songs this year, more if there is time.)</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Obligatory 'Goals for 2019' Post","date":"January 03, 2019","draft":false,"starID":105,"postType":"misc"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/obligatory-goals-for-2019-post/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/interesting-monopoly-probabilities-to-defeat-your-relatives/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"29 December, 2018","title":"Interesting Monopoly Probabilities (To Defeat your Relatives For the Holidays!)","draft":false,"starID":103,"postType":"data","link":"https://chrisfrew.in/interesting-monopoly-probabilities-to-defeat-your-relatives/","relativeLink":"/interesting-monopoly-probabilities-to-defeat-your-relatives/"}},"next":null}}
