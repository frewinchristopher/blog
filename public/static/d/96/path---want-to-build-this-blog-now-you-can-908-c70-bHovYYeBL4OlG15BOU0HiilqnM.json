(Not to mention the source code of this site itself is all public <a href=\"https://github.com/frewinchristopher/chrisfrew.in\">here on GitHub</a>). </p>\n<p>Full disclosure, this blog <em>is</em> a GatsbyJS site, which has been displayed in the footer since the blog first started.</p>\n<p>At the end of October, I was invited to Skillshare to teach a course in web development. Over the past few years I’ve been taking out large amounts of free time to work towards being the best professional full stack developer that I can be. Today, this new stage of that goal has come to fruition. In the past three weeks, being new to video recording and editing, I built my course. Just yesterday, I finally published it. It was a great experience for me and I hope you give it a try if you are interested!</p>\n<p>I decided to make my first course on Skillshare about building a blog site because through this blog, I’ve already networked with a variety of very cool people, and it’s been extremely rewarding and motivating to me that there are people who can benefit from what I share! </p>\n<p>One kind soul has already donated to my blog for one of those detailed SAP ABAP posts. 🙏🙏🙏 I’m looking forward to make many more courses over the coming months (and years?!?) to give back to a community that has already given me so much! I’ll be happy to post updates as this part of my career develops.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested, you can <a href=\"https://skl.sh/2qGtFlG\">use my promo link</a> to get 2 months of Skillshare for <strong>FREE</strong>, plus I’ll get $10 for the referral! I’m pretty sure that is a win for you, me, and Skillshare!</p>\n<p>If you decide to take the course, thank you! Be sure to tell me how I can improve, and what you don’t like! Teaching software skills has been on my mind for a long time now, and Skillshare seemingly dropped out of the sky as a perfect platform to be able to do that.</p>\n<p>Enjoy! 🍺</p>\n<p>Chris</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Want to Build a Blog Just Like This One?
