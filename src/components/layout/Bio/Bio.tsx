                    Hi! I'm Chris!
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Ah... ðŸ˜Œ I still remember opening up my very first Bash
                        terminal... it was a late summer day in September in
                        Cornell's Engineering Quad...
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <div className="text-center">
                    <h3>
                        <Sparkles wipeType="love">
                            It was love at first sight!
                        </Sparkles>
                    </h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                    From that first Bash terminal, I've since learned a variety
                    of frameworks, databases, design patterns, and languages,
                    including TypeScript, JavaScript, .NET, Python, React,
                    Redux, ABAP, SAPUI5 UI5, C#, PHP7, Postgresql, and Magento.
                    I love the challenge of building profitable SaaS products!

                    I'm also a full stack software educator: I cherish teaching
                    what I've learned over the years, because I think software
                    development is especially difficult these days, with all the
                    new tools and frameworks that seem to come out daily. I
                    focus both advanced and niche topics in my courses and each
                    course always is considered as part of a wider scope of the
                    full stack software ecosystem. If such courses sound
                    interesting to you, please checkout{" "}

                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't want anyone to be intimated by the noise of the
                    software world - I too struggle and reach out from time to
                    time for help and mentoring. To this end, I try to make my
                    courses as clear as possible so you don't get lost or
                    confused.
