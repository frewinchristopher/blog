# The Future is Here!

I've been thinking of making these animated blog posts.

They're gonna be **BIG**, with **BIG DATA**, and to help with that, I'm gonna be adding these **COOL SLIDE-Y THING-YS** to keep the numbers more clear:

<Revealer count={1} component={<img src={sign}/>}/>

Wow! That sign slides right in! Scroll down for more aMaZiNg slide-in Pok√©mon signs!!!

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Here's one:

<Revealer count={1} component={<img src={sign}/>}/>


<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

and two:

<Revealer count={2} component={<img src={sign}/>}/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

and three!

<Revealer count={3} component={<img src={sign}/>}/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

and four!!

<Revealer count={4} component={<img src={sign}/>}/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

and five!!!

<Revealer count={5} component={<img src={sign}/>}/>

You must have noticed those exclamation points increased in number as you scrolled down, and as my excitement grew! 

(Of course you did!)

Alright, that's enough funny business for now, but expect **BIG THINGS** coming from the blog! 2021 should be a good one!

Cheers! :beer:
