title: My First and Final Statement on Bitcoin for this Blog

Lots of words have been thrown around Bitcoin recently. Tulip Madness. Silk Road. Ponzi Scheme. While this blog will (rest assured) remain about software development and programming, I had to give my final say (barring what a spew on reddit :) ) SOMEWHERE about bitcoin, and let me promise you, I won't post about Bitcoin (in relation to politics or economics) every again.

The simple economics are: there will only every 21 million of them, it was the first of its kind (certainly not the best - many improvements in other coins and blockchain protocols exist). But the fact still stands, bitcoin has the largest AND majority market cap among all the other currencies.

A comic I thought up about Bitcoin :)

As cash flows from standard gold to Bitcoin, the market cap could approach the _trillions_ range. With that order of magnitude of market cap, 1 Bitcoin would have:

Market Capitalization | Bitcoin price*
1 Trillion | ~$53,000
2 Trillion | ~$105,000
3 Trillion | ~$158,000
... |
7 Trillion (market cap of gold) | ~$368,000

\*(assume around 19 million bitcoins - currently 16.7 as of writing this entry)

I predict:

- $20,000 by January 1st 2018
- $50,000 by end of Q2 2018
- $100,000 by end of Q4 2018

# Here's what has to happen for the price of Bitcoin to crash
- Actually, if 100% of people who bought became true 100% hodlers, the price would remain constant

Let it stand as a permanant marker:

**as of 16:08 UTC, Tuesday december 12, 2017 the mid-market price on GDAX for 1 Bitcoin was $17,450.**
