# Links to All Parts of the Process

Before I get into the description, you may be here just to get the links. Well, scroll no further:

- [Part 2 of ???: Building a Node.js Server Monitor]()
- [Part 3 of ???: Building a Site Differential Sensing Twitter Bot]()

# Automation To The Moon :rocket:

As an attempt to make my [doing business as (DBA) company]() more automated, and to make myself a better developer, I've decided to take steps to automate as much as possible

# Roadmap

# Improvements

- A global log class that creates logs of activity and errors across all sites. Such a class could be used in my Twitter bot as well
- Convert to a reactive , that is, don't just send an email but attemp to fix what is broken (think )
