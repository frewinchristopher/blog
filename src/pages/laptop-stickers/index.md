# Laptop Stickers!

![So hipster. Much win. Yes.](./laptopstickers1.jpg)

Nothing shows others better that you are a humble, totally epic developer, than putting really cheap stickers on your really expensive laptop!

(Okay, I can't be _that_ humble since I'm bragging about a few 50&cent; stickers on a blog - and I'm even wrong on a second account - my Mac here is used, from 2013, and only set me back about $700 :smile:)

# Tech stack

Okay, I'm lying; there are a few stickers there of tools I haven't used in a real yet, but am learning and plan to very soon:

- Redux
- TypeScript
- ReactiveX

Otherwise, it's my honest-to-goodness workflow tools.

# So You Wanna Be Cool Too, Eh?

I ordered all of these on [redbubble.com](redbubble.com) No, no, it's not what you think, its not an affiliate link! In fact, a good start portal for RedBubble is [devstickers.com](devstickers.com). Unfortunately, I found I often had to find the 4-per-page stickers in order to have a sticker size that was suitable for me, _obviously_ so I could fit as many dev stickers as possible on my laptop :joy: - see the picture for reference.

Cheers! :beer:
