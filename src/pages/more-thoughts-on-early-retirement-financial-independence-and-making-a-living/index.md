This post has been building within me for quiet a while, namely from the depressing nonsense I've seen thrown around our very own interwebs. 

Mind you, they aren't directly depressing to me, but rather, they're making me depressed on behalf of other people because I think people throwing numbers around don't really know what they are getting into. Let me explain what I mean. All over online chat boards, (reddit included), I see target "early" retirement / financial independent net worth figures of _at least_ 1 million, most 2.5 million _or higher_. Obviously, throwing these targets around make you sound cool and everything seems achievable, but let's dive into the numbers to see the amount of effort that.

I'm just going off of statistics here. Lets say you make 80K a year (even that is generous, hell, the median American salary is somewhere between $57,000 - $59,000 according to the US census: https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html). If you are the average American, you invest/save 6% of your saveable income per year (Source: https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement). So, you would need 208 years to reach 1 million, and 520 to reach 2.5 million. Oh, you complain, my average 4% return on investment. Yeah you're right, let me build that in. Ok, now its XXX to get to 1 million and XXX to get to 2.5 million.

Yeah. Let's let that sink in for a while. 

Still wanna get to 1 million before "pulling the trigger"? (Another term that rubs me the wrong way).

I think too often, people throw these massive numbers around, and haven't run the numbers themselves. Listen, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Let's raise your salary to CEO levels of 250K per year. with 6% savings rate, you still need 66 years to reach that 1 million target.

Even at my own cheapo-ass savings rate of about 60% per year, I would need 20 years to reach 1 million, and a whopping 52 to reach 2.5 million. Yes, too often stories are told about the alluring career paths of 30-40% salary upgrades every 5 years. These are paths, usually filled with luck, that are made out of maybe 1 in every 10,000 workers. Perhaps everyone will think they will get a 10% raise each year. I'm sorry, I think that's a bunch of snake oil. In short:

***Unless your savings rate is 90% or higher, net worth targets of 1 million or higher are NOT possible to be included in early retirement / financial independence plans.***

If you wish to take the normal route, amassing wealth until you hit your big million dollar targets, well, enjoy, you will be 80+ years old and will be sitting on a massive stack of cash that you won't even have time to use. Pretty dumb. It sounds harsh, but you just saw all the numbers.

Therefore, I follow a wise mentor Mr. Money Moustache, and propose a modest (although, as you will soon see, still very surprisingly powerful) new target net work amount for financial independence / early retirement: 

***$600,000.00***

I hear you laughing: "600K?!" You chuckle, "Why, that's just only over _half_ of a big ol' million!" Well excuse me, with 600K you can:

Spend 100K per year for 6 years (that's already a ridiculous amount - do you need 2 model S's per year?)
Live in a nice Brooklyn or NYC high rise apartment for 20 years (this is at 2.5K a month - even in New York, you can get a pretty nice apartment with that price tag)
Or, like me (which is why it is my "financial independence" target), live for 24 years on a 25K a year budget.

Even though the 600K number itself may still be boggling some of you, there are even _more_ hidden benefits in all those scenarios above. I haven't included a key variable: _time_. Assuming your 600K is all in S&P500 indexes (which is should, but that is a whole 'nother post) You effectively had:

100K @ 4% for 5 years

200K @ 4% for 4 years

300K @ 4% for 3 years

400K @ 4% for 2 years

500K @ 4% for 1 year

Because you're only cashing out 100K per year. You could imagine an even better outcome for the less rash scenarios which are over 20-25 years.

Let me be clear on my opinion of financial independence and early retirement: it is NOT to escape work for the rest of your life!!! It is to ensure an effectively massive cushion so that a human can focus on neat projects, whether extremely difficult, charitable, or creative, and not have to worry about the next pay check (which are by the way are perpendicular goals)

Because, let's be honest, if you can't find an job opportunity or a new way to ensure income in a decade, you've got bigger problems than worrying about income in the first place.

For the sake of tax purposes, losses from essentials like health insurance and rent and all that nonsense, lets say I need a total of 700K to be, in my terms, financially independent.
Lets think of this 700K in terms of simple exchange for services. I need:

1 person to give me $700000 (ha!)
7 people to give me $100000 (still ha!)
70 people to give me $10000 (eh...)
700 people to give me $1000 (with a _very_ nice product/service I could see this partially happening)
7,000 people to give me $100 (alright, now we're getting there)
70,000 people to give me $10 (if you go viral, yes)
700,000 people to give me $1 (just for the sake of completeness)

Let's consider returning customers:

35 people to give me $10000 _twice_ 
350 people to give me $1000 _twice_ 
3500 people to give me $100 _twice_ 
35,000 people to give me $10 _twice_ 
350,000 people to give me $1 _twice_ 

With a very nice brand/product/service:

14 people to give me $10000 _five times_ 
140 people to give me $1000 _five times_ 
1400 people to give me $100 _five times_ 
14000 people to give me $10 _five times_ 
140,000 people to give me $1 _five times_ 

So this is my call to all millennials to try and do this. Unless you truly know you are one of the group that can reach 1 million (and you probably know who you are), don't try and shoot for these crazy targets. 

So my final message to everyone is this: build your 600K foundation, then start your independent or freelancing career, even if your not sure of what to do. (Besides, who is ever 100% sure of anything?) Remember, with moderate living you have 20-25 years time to ride out, and BUILD SOMETHING! Start a charity, build massive works of art: remember, you won't need ANY income for two decades. The only question remains is:

What will you build?
