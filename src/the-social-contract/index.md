This is going to be an ongoing bullet point of some of my own 'personal'. They probably relate to most other, if not all, professions and occupations. Each point has a bit of justification and reasoning behind it. This list may grow.

-  As the working software engineer with significant income, always buy beers for the bachelor students at bars, parties and similar (this includes trainees, apprentices, ).
  - Justification & Reasoning: it was always the case that older people while I was growing and learning and its only correct to do the same and keep the cycle going.
- Take advice-giving seriously and explain it well
  - Justification & Reasoning: I've advised my younger brother on what to. Also try to notice anything you say that sounds clich√©s and concretely state that, but being serious in your advice. I say this because whenever I received advice from elders or role models, it often sounds cliche, and then I went off and ignored the advice to do my own thing, only to find that the advice given was actually quite accurate.
- Don't give specific advice on large life decisions (getting married, buying a house/apartment, etc.) to someone if it is not asked!
  - I think struggle and doing this not the perfect way is a part of being human and what teaches us good strategies. To me these struggles and internal battles, that could may well have been avoided with the proper part of self development.
